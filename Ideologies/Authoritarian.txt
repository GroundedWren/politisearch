actors Spains case including military Catholic Church Falange monarchists technocrats others unlike totalitarian states regime relies passive mass acceptance rather than popular support Several subtypes authoritarian regimes have been identified Linz others Linz identified most basic subtypes traditional authoritarian regimes authoritarian regimes Traditional authoritarian regimes those which ruling authority generally single person maintained power through combination appeals traditional legitimacy patronclient ties repression which carried apparatus bound ruling authority through personal loyalties example Ethiopia under Haile Selassie authoritarian regimes those governed coalition military officers technocrats pragmatically rather than ideologically within limits their bureaucratic mentality Mark Gasiorowski suggests that best distinguish simple military authoritarian regimes from bureaucratic authoritarian regimes which powerful group technocrats uses state apparatus rationalize develop economy such South Korea under Park Chunghee Linz also identified three other subtypes authoritarian regime corporatist racial ethnic democracy Corporatist authoritarian regimes those which corporatism institutions used extensively state coopt demobilize powerful interest groups this type been studied most extensively Latin America Racial ethnic democracies those which certain racial ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others largely entirely denied those rights such South Africa under apartheid authoritarian regimes those which totalitarian institutions such party secret police mass media remain where ideological orthodoxy declined favor routinization repression declined states leadership less personalized more secure level mass

ever call publicly Shahs resignation However Presidents special emissary George Ball reportedly concluded that Shah cannot hope maintain total power must bargain with moderate segment opposition known have discussed various alternatives that would effectively ease Shah total power Washington December There furthermore much doubt that assisted Shahs departure helped arrange succession Bakhtiar Iran Carter commitment proved stronger than strategic considerations national pride What rest world regarded stinging American defeat government matter settled Iranians personally prefer that Shah maintain major role government President acknowledged that decision Iranian people make Events Nicaragua also departed from scenario presented above both because Cuban Soviet roles were clearer because officials were more intensely publicly working against Somoza After Somoza regime defeated first wave Sandinista violence ceased imposed sanctions took other steps which undermined status credibility government domestic foreign affairs Between murder correspondent Bill Stewart National Guardsman early June Sandinista victory late July State Department assigned ambassador refused submit credentials Somoza even though Somoza still chief state called replacing government with broadly based provisional government that would include Sandinista guerillas Americans were assured Assistant Secretary State Viron Vaky that Nicaraguans democratic friends Latin America have intention seeing Nicaragua turned into second Cuba even though State Department knew that Sandinista leaders close personal ties were continuing contact with Havana more specifically that Cuban secretpolice official Julian Lopez frequently present Sandinista headquarters that Cuban military advisers were present Sandinista ranks manner Carter administration which generally seems willing negotiate anything with anyone anywhere government adopted oddly uncompromising posture dealing with Somoza crisis possible said Vaky that does start with departure Somoza from power regime negotiation mediation compromise achieved longer with Somoza government solution only begin with sharp break from past Trying hard only banned American arms sales government Nicaragua pressured Israel Guatemala others likewiseall name insuring democratic outcome Finally Sandinista leaders consolidated control over weapons communications banned opposition took Cuba President Carter warned against attributing this evolutionary change Cuban machinations assured world that desired only people Nicaragua choose their form government despite variations Carter administration brought crises Iran Nicaragua several common assumptions each which played major role hastening victory even more repressive dictatorships than been place before These were first belief that there existed moment crisis democratic alternative incumbent government second belief that continuation status possible third belief that change including establishment government headed selfstyled Marxist preferable present government Each these beliefs widely shared liberal community generally them withstand close scrutiny lthough most governments world they always have been autocracies kind another idea holds greater sway mind educated Americans than belief that possible democratize governments anytime anywhere under circumstances This notion belied enormous body evidence based experience dozens countries which have attempted with more less usually less success move from autocratic democratic government Many wisest political scientists this previous centuries agree that democratic institutions especially difficult establish they make heavy demands portions population because they depend complex social cultural economic conditions three decades when Marxism enjoyed greatest prestige among American intellectuals economic prerequisites democracy that were emphasized social scientists Democracy they argued could function only relatively rich societies with advanced economy substantial middle class literate population could expected emerge more less automatically whenever these conditions prevailed Today this picture seems grossly oversimplified While surely helps have economy strong enough provide decent levels wellbeing open enough provide mobility encourage achievement pluralistic society right kind political cultureand timeare even more essential essay Representative Government John Stuart Mill identified three fundamental conditions which Carter administration would well ponder These that people should willing receive representative government that they should willing able what necessary preservation three that they should willing able fulfill duties discharge functions which imposes them Fulfilling duties discharging functions representative government make heavy demands leaders citizens demands participation restraint consensus compromise necessary citizens avidly interested politics wellinformed about public more widespread interest mobilization needed than autocracies What necessary that substantial number citizens think themselves participants societys decisionmaking simply subjects bound laws Moreover leaders major sectors society must agree pursue power only legal means must eschew least principle violence theft fraud must accept defeat when necessary They must also skilled finding creating common ground among diverse points view interests correlatively willing compromise most basic values addition appropriate political culture democratic government requires institutions strong enough channel contain conflict Voluntary nonofficial institutions needed articulate aggregate diverse interests opinions present society Otherwise formal governmental institutions will able translate popular demands into public policy relatively places where they exist democratic governments have come into being slowly after extended prior experience with more limited forms participation during which leaders have reluctantly grown accustomed tolerating dissent opposition opponents have accepted notion that they defeat destroy incumbents people have become aware governments effects their lives their possible effects government Decades centuries normally required people acquire necessary disciplines habits Britain road from Magna Carta Settlement great Reform Bills took seven centuries traverse American history gives better grounds believing that democracy comes easily quickly asking independence unsuccessful constitution civil long process gradual marked progress toward constitutional democratic government French path still more difficult Terror dictatorship monarchy instability incompetence followed revolution that usher millennium brotherhood Only century democratic principle finally gain wide acceptance France until after World were principles order democracy popular sovereignty authority finally reconciled institutions strong enough contain conflicting currents public opinion Although there instance revolutionary socialist Communist society being democratized rightwing autocracies sometimes evolve into time propitious economic social political circumstances talented leaders strong indigenous demand representative government Something kind progress Iberian peninsula first steps have been taken Brazil Something similar could conceivably have also occurred Iran Nicaragua contestation participation been more gradually expanded seems clear that architects contemporary American foreign policy have little idea about encouraging liberalization autocracy neither Nicaragua Iran they realize that only likely result effort replace incumbent autocrat with moderate critics broadbased coalition would foundations existing regime without moving nation closer democracy this outcome entirely predictable Authority traditional autocracies transmitted through personal relations from ruler close associates relatives household members personal friends from them people whom associates related personal ties resembling their relation ruler fabric authority unravels quickly when power status undermined eliminated longer autocrat held power more pervasive personal influence more dependent nations institutions will Without organized life society will collapse like arch from which keystone been removed blend qualities

complex unfamiliar political practices societies lacking requisite political culture tradition social structures only fail produce desired outcomes they undertaken time when traditional regime under

scheduled take place under conditions guerrilla actions Iran Nicaragua reflect pervasive mistaken assumption that easily locate impose democratic alternatives incumbent autocracies they also reflect equally pervasive equally flawed belief that change such autocracies inevitable desirable American interest this belief which induces Carter administration participate actively toppling nonCommunist autocracies while remaining passive face Communist expansion time Carter administration came into office widely reported that President assembled team shared approach foreign policy conception national interest principal elements this approach were said conviction that cold over conviction that this being case should give priority NorthSouth problems help less developed nations achieve their destiny More involved these changes than originally meets unlikely seem foreign policy Carter administration guided relatively fullblown philosophy history which includes philosophies history always theory social change currently called doctrine modernization Like most other philosophies history that have appeared West since century Carter doctrine predicts progress form modernization societies happy ending form world community developed autonomous nations approach foreign affairs clearly foreshadowed Zbigniew Brzezinskis book role technetronic Between Ages that book Brzezinski showed that imagination look beyond cold brave world global politics deal with that world approach said evolving which Brzezinski designated rational humanism approach preoccupation with national supremacy would give global perspectives international problems would viewed human issues rather than political confrontations traditional intellectual framework dealing with foreign policy would have scrapped Today framework international politics with their spheres influence military alliances between nation states fiction sovereignty doctrinal conflicts arising from thcentury crisisis clearly longer compatible with reality Only delayed development Soviet Union archaic religious community that experiences modernity existentially quite normatively prevented wider realization fact that ideology already here Brzezinski recommended great deal patience more detached attitude toward world revolutionary processes less anxious preoccupation with Soviet Union Instead gaging ancient diplomatic pastimes should make broader effort contain global tendencies toward chaos while assisting processes change that will move world toward community developed nations central concern Brzezinskis book Carter foreign policy with modernization Third World From beginning administration manifested special intense interest problems socalled Third World instead viewing international developments terms American national interest national interest historically conceived architects administration policy have viewed them terms contemporary version same idea progress that traumatized Western imaginations since Enlightenment current form concept modernization involves more than more than political development whatever that used instead designate process through which traditional society passes transformed into society characterized machine technology rational secular attitudes highly differentiated social structures Condorcet Comte Hegel Marx Weber present this view history working idea modernity crucial elements modernization concept have been clearly explicated Samuel Huntington despite period National Security Council assuredly architect policy modernization paradigm Huntington observed postulates ongoing process change complex because involves dimensions human life society systemic because elements interact predictable necessary ways global because societies will necessarily pass through transition from traditional modern lengthy because time required modernize economic social organization character culture phased because each modernizing society must pass through essentially same stages homogenizing because tends toward convergence societies irreversible because direction change given relation elements process progressive sense that desirable long provides significant benefits affiliated people lthough modernization paradigm proved sometimes useful well influential tool social science become object searching critiques that have challenged after another central assumptions shortcomings analytical tool pale however when compared inadequacies framework thinking about foreign policy where principal effects encourage view that events manifestations deep historical forces which cannot controlled that best government serve midwife history helping events move where they already headed This perspective contemporary events optimistic

country here Anthony Lake chief State Departments Policy Planning staff South Africa Change will come South Africa welfare people there American interests will profoundly affected which comes question whether will peaceful Brzezinski makes point still clearer Speaking chief National Security Council assured that struggles power Asia Africa really only incidents along route modernization developing countries from northeast Asia southern Africa continue search viable forms government capable managing process modernization matter that invasions coups civil wars political struggles less violent kinds that sees around incidents global personnel search someone manage modernization process Neither Brzezinski anyone else seems bothered fact that political participants that from northeast Asia southern Africa that they searching viable forms government capable managing process modernization motives intentions real persons more relevant modernization paradigm than they Marxist view history Viewed from this level abstraction forces rather than people that count what deep historical forces work such diverse places Iran Horn Africa Southeast Asia Central America United Nations look like Russians Cubans Having moved past what President calls inordinate fear Communism identified with Cold should told capable distinguishing Soviet Cuban machinations which anyway exist mainly minds cold warriors others guilty world from evolutionary changes which seem only kind that actually occur What President faced with such complicated inexorable impersonal processes answer offered again again President officials much Since events caused human decisions they cannot stopped altered them Brzezinski example said recognize that world changing under influence forces government control Cyrus Vance cautioned fact that more stop change than Canute could still waters Carter essentially deterministic apolitical view contemporary events discourages active American response encourages passivity American inability influence events Iran became Presidents theme song Those argue that should could intervene directly thwart revolution Iran wrong about realities Iran have encouraged limited extent ability public support Bakhtiar government long Shah will Iran have determine Future events desires will determine that impossible anyone anticipate future political events Even been able anticipate events that were going take place Iran other countries obviously ability determine those events very limited emphasis added Vance made same point Iran policy throughout current crisis been based fact that only Iranians resolve fundamental political issues which they confront Where once upon time American President might have sent Marines assure protection American strategic interests there room force this world progress Force President told Notre Dame does work that lesson extracted from Vietnam offers only superficial solutions Concerning Iran said Certainly have desire ability intrude massive forces into Iran other country determine outcome domestic political issues This something that have intention ever doing another country Weve tried this once Vietnam didnt work well know There nothing unique about Iran Nicaragua climate language were different historical forces response were same Military intervention question Assistant Secretary State Viron Vaky described unthinkable military power intervene internal affairs another American republic Vance provided parallel assurances Africa asserting that would match Cuban Soviet activities there function foreign policy under these conditions understand processes change then like Marxists align ourselves with history hoping contribute stability along this administration spokesmen assure precisely what doing Carter administration defined national interest Third World identical with putative modernization process Vance this with characteristic candor recent statement when explained that policy visavis Third World grounded conviction that best serve interest there supporting efforts developing nations advance their economic wellbeing preserve their political independence commitment promotion constructive change worldwide Brzezinskis words been vouchsafed every conceivable context there problem conceivable contexts turn mainly those which nonCommunist autocracies under pressure from revolutionary guerrillas Since Moscow aggressive expansionist power today more often than insurgents encouraged armed Soviet Union challenge status American commitment change abstract ends aligning tacitly with Soviet clients irresponsible extremists like Ayatollah Khomeini Yasir Arafat assisting change Carter administration undertake Communist country principles thus both selectively applied seem accept status Communist nations name diversity national autonomy nations ruled rightwing dictators white oligarchies Concerning China example Brzezinski observed recognize that have different ideologies economic political systems harbor neither hope desire that through extensive contacts with China remake that nation into American image Indeed accept differences Southeast Asia President noted February interest promote peace withdrawal outside forces become embroiled conflict among Asian nations general interest promote health development individual societies pattern exactly like ours United States tailored rather hopes needs desires peoples involved position shifts sharply when South Africa discussed example Anthony Lake asserted late have indicated South Africa fact that does make significant progress toward racial equality relations with international community including United States bound deteriorate Over years have tried through series progressive steps demonstrate that cannot will associated with continued practice apartheid Nicaragua Hodding Carter said February unwillingness Nicaraguan government accept groups proposal resulting prospects renewal polarization humanrights situation Nicaragua unavoidably affect kind relationships maintain with that government Carter commented Latin American autocracies government will deterred from protecting human rights including economic social rights whatever ways prefer take actions that positive where nations persist serious violations human rights will continue demonstrate that there costs flagrant disregard international standards omething very going here does administration that desires people work their destinies involved determined efforts reform South Africa Zaire Nicaragua Salvador elsewhere administration committed Cambodia Vietnam announce that will deterred from righting wrongs South Africa What should made administration that sees interest identical with economic modernization political independence heedlessly endangers political independence Taiwan country whose success economic modernization egalitarian distribution wealth unequaled Asia contrast striking that between frenzied speed recognizing dictatorship Nicaragua continuing refusal recognize elected government Zimbabwe Rhodesia refusal maintain presence Zimbabwe Rhodesia while staffing Information Office Cuba only there ideology double standard work here ideology neither fits explains reality double standard involves administration wholesale contradiction principles familiar part politics most societies Usually however governments behave hypocritically when their principles conflict with national interest What makes Carter administration noteworthy first moralism which renders especially vulnerable charges hypocrisy second predilection policies that violate strategic economic interests United States conception national interest borders doublethink finds friendly powers guilty status views triumph unfriendly groups beneficial Americas true interests This logic quite obviously reinforced prejudices preferences many administration officials Traditional autocracies general their very nature deeply offensive modern American sensibilities notion that public affairs should ordered basis kinship friendship other personal relations rather than basis objective rational standards violates conception justice efficiency preference stability rather than change also disturbing Americans whose whole national experience rests principles change growth progress extremes wealth poverty characteristic traditional societies also offend more since poor usually very poor bound their squalor hereditary allocation role Moreover relative lack concern rich comfortable rulers poverty ignorance disease their people likely interpreted Americans moral dereliction pure simple truth that Americans hardly bear such societies such rulers Confronted with them vaunted cultural relativism evaporates become censorious Cotton Mather confronting England politics traditional autocracy nearly antithetical ownat both symbolic operational levelthe rhetoric progressive sounds much better their symbols much more acceptable reason that some modern Americans prefer socialist traditional autocracies that former have embraced modernity have adopted modern modes perspectives including instrumental manipulative functional orientation toward most social cultural personal affairs profession universalistic norms emphasis reason science education progress deemphasis sacred rational bureaucratic organizations They speak language Because socialism variety ideology rooted version same values that sparked Enlightenment democratic revolutions century because modern traditional because postulates goals that appeal Christian well secular values brotherhood elimination power mode human relations highly congenial many Americans symbolic level Marxist speak language hopeful future while traditional autocrats speak language unattractive past Because leftwing invoke symbols values egalitarianism rather than hierarchy privilege liberty rather than order activity rather than passivitythey again again accepted partisans cause freedom democracy owhere affinity liberalism Christianity Marxist socialism more apparent than among liberals duped time after time into supporting liberators turn totalitarians among Leftleaning clerics whose attraction secular style redemptive community stronger than their outrage hostility socialist regimes religion Jimmy optimist liberal Christianthe tendency repelled frankly nondemocratic rulers hierarchical societies almost strong tendency attracted idea popular revolution liberation progress Carter excellence kind liberal most likely confound revolution with idealism

Carters doctrine national interest modernization encourages support change that takes place name people regardless superficial Marxist antiAmerican content lingering doubt about whether should case

Carter administration this sort progressive liberalism Carter administration came power after committed precisely reducing centrality strategic competition with Moscow American foreign policy extending United States association with what prepared accept legitimate popular movements around worldfirst with victorious movement Vietnam Indochina supposed state which Americans could demonstrate their postVietnam intent come terms with progressive popular element that Kissinger villain denied other words Carter administration Rosenfeld tells came power resolved assess international developments light coldwar perspectives accept face value claim revolutionary groups represent popular aspirations progressive ties these Soviet Union this overtures were made looking normalization relations with Vietnam Cuba Chinese Peoples Republic steps were taken cool relations with South Korea South Africa Nicaragua Philippines others These moves followed naturally from conviction that enemies said been wrong side history supporting status opposing revolution might have thought that this perspective would have been undermined events Southeast Asia since triumph progressive forces there over agents reaction cite Rosenfeld again this adminstrations time Vietnam been transformed much American public opinion from country wronged revealing brutal essence ownThis been quiet major trauma Carter people liberals scarring their selfconfidence their claim public trust alike Presumably however barbarity progressive governments Cambodia Vietnam been less traumatic President chief advisers than Rosenfeld since there little evidence changed crucial levels White House State Department President continues behave beforenot like abhors autocrats like abhors only rightwing autocrats

Caribbean although SovietCuban role Grenada Nicaragua Salvador plus transfer MIGs Cuba already prompted resumption surveillance Cuba which turn confirmed presence Soviet combat brigade Presidents eagerness heat climate public opinion remains stronger than commitment speak truth American people statement Nicaragua clearly reflects these priorities mistake Americans assume claim that every time evolutionary change takes place this hemisphere that somehow result secret massive Cuban intervention fact Nicaragua that Somoza regime lost confidence people bring about orderly transition there effort people Nicaragua ultimately make decision would their leaderwhat form government they should have This statement which presumably represents Presidents best thinking matter illuminating Carters effort dismiss concern about military events this specific country manifestation national proclivity seeing Cuban machinations under every constitutes shocking effort falsify reality There question Nicaragua evolutionary change attributing such change Castros agents There only question about appropriate response military struggle country whose location gives strategic importance proportion size strength that rest Presidents statement graphically illustrates blinding power ideology interpretation events When says that Somoza regime lost confidence people President implies that regime previously rested confidence people that situation changed fact Somoza regime never rested popular will instead manipulation force habit being ousted instead succumbing arms soldiers However assumption that armed conflict Sandinistas Somozistas military equivalent national referendum enabled President imagine that could should settled people Nicaragua this pious sentiment even seem true President would have unaware that insurgents were receiving great many arms from other nonNicaraguans that played significant role disarming Somoza regime Presidents mistakes distortions fashionable ones assumptions those people want badly progressive side conflicts between rightist autocracy leftist challenges prefer latter almost regardless probable consequences sure neither President Vance Brzezinski desires proliferation regimes Each asserted disapproval Soviet interference modernization process each nevertheless remains willing destabilize friendly neutral autocracies without assurance that they will replaced reactionary totalitarian theocracies totalitarian Soviet client states worst murderous fanatics variety foreign policy Carter administration fails lack good intentions lack realism about nature traditional versus revolutionary autocracies relation each American national interest Only intellectual fashion tyranny RightLeft thinking prevent intelligent good will from perceiving facts that traditional authoritarian governments less repressive than revolutionary autocracies that they more susceptible liberalization that they more compatible with interests evidence these points clear enough urely beyond reasonable doubt that present governments Vietnam Cambodia Laos much more repressive than those despised previous rulers that government Peoples Republic China more repressive than that Taiwan that North Korea more repressive than South Korea forth This most important lesson Vietnam Cambodia gruesome reminder harsh facts From time time truly bestial ruler come power either type autocracyIdi Amin Papa Duvalier Joseph Stalin examplesbut neither type regularly produces such moral monsters though democracy regularly prevents their accession power There however systemic differences between traditional revolutionary autocracies that have predictable effect their degree repressiveness Generally speaking traditional autocrats tolerate social inequities brutality poverty while revolutionary autocracies create them Traditional autocrats leave place existing allocations wealth power status other sources which most traditional societies favor affluent maintain masses poverty they worship traditional gods observe traditional taboos They disturb habitual rhythms work leisure habitual places residence habitual patterns family personal relations Because miseries traditional life familiar they bearable ordinary people growing society learn cope children born untouchables India acquire skills attitudes necessary survival miserable roles they destined fill Such societies create refugees Precisely opposite true revolutionary Communist regimes They create refugees million because they claim jurisdiction over whole life society make demands change that violate internalized values habits that inhabitants flee tens thousands remarkable expectation that their attitudes values goals will better foreign country than their native land former deputy chairman Vietnams National Assembly from defection early August Hoang Hoan described recently impact Vietnams ongoing revolution that countrys more than million Chinese inhabitants They have been expelled from places they have lived generations They have been dispossessed virtually lands their houses They have been driven into areas called economic zones they have been given they living such conditions reclaiming land They gradually number hard life They also humiliation only Chinese have suffered Southeast Asia since liberation only Vietnam that Chinese suffer more than million refugees fled countries ruled Marxist governments spite walls fences guns sharks steady stream people fleeing revolutionary utopias continues There damning contrast between number refugees created Marxist regimes those created other autocracies more than million Cubans have left their homeland since Castros rise refugee every nine inhabitants compared about each from Argentina Brazil Chile Africa more than five times many refugees have fled Guinea Guinea Bissau have left Zimbabwe Rhodesia suggesting that civil racial discrimination easier most people bear than Marxiststyle liberation Moreover history this century provides grounds expecting that radical totalitarian regimes will transform themselves moment there greater likelihood progressive liberalization governments Brazil Argentina Chile than government Cuba Taiwan than Peoples Republic China South Korea than North Korea Zaire than Angola forth Since many traditional autocracies permit limited contestation participation impossible that policy could effectively encourage this process liberalization provided that effort made time when incumbent government fighting life against violent adversaries that proposed reforms aimed producing gradual change rather than perfect democracy overnight accomplish this policymakers needed understand actual democracies have actually come into being History better guide than good intentions realistic policy which aims protecting interest assisting capacities less developed nations will need face unpleasant fact that victorious violent insurgency headed Marxist unlikely lead anything totalitarian tyranny Armed intellectuals citing Marx supported Sovietbloc arms advisers will almost surely turn agrarian reformers simple nationalists democratic socialists However some Marxist contemporary embodiments Americans wrote Declaration Independence they will content with establishing broadbased coalition which they have only voice among many always easy distinguish between democratic totalitarian agents change also difficult Authentic democratic securing governments based consent governed believe that ordinary capable using freedom knowing their interest choosing rulers They like current leaders Nicaragua assume that will necessary postpone elections three five years during which time they cure false consciousness almost everyone moreover

Media Commentary Matthew Continetti Matthew Continetti PhotoSeth Wenig File Shares Facebook Twitter Google Email Print omini Sengupta covers United Nations York Times recently tweeted about ambassador there find Nikki Haley unusual among diplomats here wrote that speaks often without notes shes confident about what needs Imagine prepared competent spirited representative interests world body novel Sengupta appears puzzled subject only Ambassador Haley selfassured capable extemporaneous speech unlike immediate predecessors that conservative willing defend countrys ideals interests before others Moreover Haley does reflexively criticize government people ally Israel trapped within liberal bubble that such behavior comes across paper aberrant freakish worthy incredulity coverage that results almost funny when outright embarrassing Example March Sengupta wrote piece with alarmist headline Envoy Draws From Playbook Aide Steeped Conservative Ideology article profile Haleys chief staff Steven Groves newsworthy Because described himself champion American sovereignty written forcefully against international agreements ideas have infused ambassadors remarks Shocking know Years when worked Senate Permanent Subcommittee Investigations Groves investigated OilforFood scandal which officials covered Iraqi abuse international program that allowed Saddam Hussein sell humanitarian relief this detail Grovess résumé interests Sengupta less than work Heritage Foundation whose analysts have advocated scrutiny peacekeeping operations argue that United States should more than percent budget Ambassador Haleythis might surprise yousupports both policies other Heritage Foundation priorities have already found their into ambassadors Conspiracy Sengupta just asking questions article thin

exist This news York Times More insidious because betrayed canons objective journalism Senguptas report speech Haley delivered Council Foreign Relations March Nikki Haley Calls United Nations Human Rights Council Corrupt Note paper distances itself from Haleys claim implies that egregious false using quotations headline scare quotes also appear lead American envoy United Nations Nikki Haley described United States Wednesday moral conscience world dismissed United Nations Human Rights Council corrupt without offering evidence detached style copy fails conceal spirit adversarial condescension which written This article labeled opinion analysis fact check purports dispassionate retelling Haleys speech therefore misleads reader juxtaposing Haleys statements with Senguptas barely disguised commentary following excerpts emphasis Haley said United States would never close doors foreigners flee persecution even defended Trump travel which closed door refugees from wartorn mainly Muslim nations insisted that American taxpayers should value money they contribute United Nations said nothing about whether United States would help head potential humanitarian disaster from famine that United Nations warned looming over million people abroad cited what called ridiculously biased report attacking Israel criticized Security Council holding monthly meetings about conflict council also discusses Yemen every month Syria three times month measure Senguptas faith taken examining above sentences first needless potshot controversial administration policy makes attempt inform reader grounds Haleys defense merely recycles opposition talking points might finish second sentence wondering Haley mention reports famine Africa Yemen reason Sengupta writes later that asked about Senguptas implication third example that Security Councils obsession with Israel deal because also discusses Yemen Syria those countries active zones sites terrorism foreign intervention humanitarian crises York Times seriously likening situation Israel whats happening Yemen Syria would commit same gross moral equivalence which stands condemned Moral equivalence between Israel adversaries might well part style guide suppose Whats remarkable about Senguptas piece that even clumsily attempts provide leftwing context Haleys appearance Council Foreign Relations cant bring herself mention that charge corruption against Human Rights Council longstanding bipartisan element foreign policy Saint Hillary Clinton herself when announced that America rejoining council said goal improving humanrights system subsequent speech chided antiIsrael bias cannot continue single devote attention country Clinton said Haleys charge obviously true council exists only because ancestor Human Rights

HealthCare Meltdown happened what means Tevi Troy Tevi Troy Shares Facebook Twitter Google Email Print became clear morning November that Republicans would have control White House Senate House come another shocking realization dawned Obamacare could repealed Republicans explicitly promise just that four successive national elections been rewarded voters when they secured majority House when they secured majority Senate when they secured presidency Throughout years following passage Affordable Care voiced opposition passing multiple repeal bills Given inevitability President Obamas veto Republicans were much derided Democrats media these seemingly futile gestures these efforts strategic purpose They were intended demonstrate Americas voters that Republicans legislative path repeal bill presidents deska bill that Republican president would actually sign mere five months later came another political shocker initial Republican effort repeal Obamacare rails planned March vote House leaders pulled their bill generically named American Health Care because they knew would fail Republican resistance from conservatives moderates alike immediate aftermath President Donald Trump pledged walk away from healthcare reform efforts Obamacare explode House Speaker Paul Ryan grimly noted that problematic legislation land that were going living with Obamacare foreseeable future What earth happened Since became Obamacare been unpopular plurality sometimes majority Americans have expressed their disapproval legislation ramifications unending series deservedly negative stories highlighted rising hidden costs imposed shrinking choices consumers under yoke botched implementation unmet promises Despite name Affordable Care hardly affordable left millions uncovered though Congress pages long administration kept rewriting delaying through questionable fiat Republicans could their caucus House vote bill they wrote begin process repealing replacing failed process that this embarrassing defeat highlighted three major challenges that faces wants successful repealing Obamacare building workable health system going forward irst there policy challenge bill failed because many Republicans found provisions discomfiting dismaying indeed flawed there around fact that bill could what everyone wishes Obamacare wanted explain bill reach presidents desk must course pass both House Senate only bill even come passage senators vote explicitly beforehand their formal debate measure This called cloture Senate rules require supermajority votes achieve cloture Republicans hold Senate majority with votes What this means practice that while they likely secure passage bill that reaches floor Republican efforts will stymied because Democrats refuse debate leave bill hanging forever endlessdebate limbo There however type legislation that passed with simple majority budget reconciliation bill process designed allow simple majorities pass budget resolutions Clever able have seized reconciliation process usher through bills unable reach vote cloture threshold Most notoriously Obamacare itself passed using reconciliation trick that became necessary early after Republican Scott Brown Massachusetts Senate seat following Kennedys death brought Democratic majority down Given current Democratic resistance changes Obamacare Republican action Trump generally Republicans choice pursue reconciliation healthcare bill through primary oddity here that House leadership that drafted bill conform demands Senate process This stems from constitutional requirement Spending packages must initiated House maneuver clever limitations reconciliation approach Republicans straightjacket both terms time policy First bill attached budget resolution Republicans decided write budget resolutions involving health care other involving reform They decided with health care firstand under arcane rules resolution process they file budget instructions formally declaring that their first budget move would center health care Once they this they could alter sequence leaders have been criticized this including President Trump said healthcare bill plunged into chaos that sorry they hadnt gone with reform first thing approach made sense First Ryan knew that Republicans were united their desire repeal Obamacare whereas there heated disagreements within Republican caucus kinds cuts reforms should pursue More important repeal Obamacare would have generated significant budgetary savings initially calculated around billion that would have been immensely helpful offsetting cost later taxreform bill confuse matters some more arcanathis time explain haste with which bill introduced voted Under process Republicans were aiming finish their first package before midMay Because instructions governing healthcare reconciliation package would expire once House initiated second budget process reform Dont other words bill through House then Senate harmonized between them before going presidents deskall matter months this need speed that Ryan introduce bill hurriedly insist House vote within days Almost aside from procedural experts understood necessity this haste Ryans action breathless accusations Republicans didnt like provisions that rushing things through moving forward dead night didnt they like Again rules governing reconciliation tell tale bill simply couldnt what Republicans seeking Obamacares full repeal replacement needed Every provision reconciliation bill must germane federal governments budget Thus Ryan bill could only change taxes spending could address central concerns healthcare policy larger goals that along with antiObamacare relief purchasing insurance across state lines association health plans tort reform like could included bill leadership pressuring members support bill could many things like reducing taxes reforming Medicaid cutting spending shrinking deficit could everything Ryan acknowledged this fact when other advocates announced that American Health Care would first three phases After reconciliation would come phase regulatory reform mostly direction Secretary Health Human Services given enormous power over implementation existing legislation Then would come phase three final steps requiring legislation that could passed only after senators agreed cloture bill Only after phrase three completed would Obamacare finally fully repealed replaced other words American Health Care intended first threeact political play that would take several years stagesince presumably would take result favorable Republicans midterm elections reach vote threshold Senate Ryan sought unsuccessfully make this clear illusory goal established Trump during campaignthe immediate repeal replacement Obamacarehad come overshadow other considerations public imagination this AHCA bill became Obamacare replacement bill bill rather than opening salvo long campaign result found wanting almost everyone week after AHCA introduced Congressional Budget Office scored announced that would cause million people lose healthcare coverage report positive aspects like significant budget savings very real prospect that would bring down health premiums over time Moreover majority those million were people would voluntarily system rather than excessive premiums Nonetheless once number announced those advocating bill pretty much lost argument momentum This horrific score relentless opposition from Democrats media reviews from conservative healthcare mavens meant that bill could gain enough support among Republicans proceed fight over bill made clear political challenge that faces Ryan Trump Republican Party whole election little unify fractious elements coalition When comes health care itis times unclear what Republicans agree otherthan aversion Obamacare Multiple fissures have appeared Some echo previous struggles over spending others portend future battles biggest between three dozen members Freedom Caucusformed serve conservative wedgeand rest House Freedom Caucus operates under premise that Republican compromises past have brought forth ever larger government Therefore compromise avoided continues lead government growth argument that half loaf better than none little appeal members they appear happy settle none alternative deal which both sides make concessions that limit size government demonstrate their determination Freedom Caucus members budge when Ryan Trump administration offered Freedom Caucus multiple concessions days preceding scheduled vote resign from Caucus afterward Ryan will have decide there work with Freedom Caucus health care Without them helacks voting majorityIf they willing work with Ryanwould need look Democrats which seems laughable proposition House Democrats have reason reach Republicans work together dismantling Democratic achievement even program significantly flawed causes Democrats some political problems their Republicans were reach Democrats their support preemptive concessions that Republicans would have offer even Democrats table would large they would likely defeat purpose effort final challenge wake bills failure philosophical needs decide where stands this central question should role government ensure that every American have health insurance Democrats have clearly determined that this their goal Republicans have that clarity Though most want surrender idea that health insurance tantamount constitutional right Republicans terrified scores showing that Americans lose coverage under their proposals Republicans face unpleasant choice here They make philosophical concession back universal coverage seem nice they acknowledge reality that some people will continue uncovered appear sensible callous they agree universal coverage they will never able match willingness Democrats spend ever more make happen including singlepayer system that effectively nationalizes healthcare Republican conservative approaches contrast provide incentives people purchase health care reducing regulations increasing choice thereby reducing price This more indirect handle problem than Democratic mandate subsidize approach Obamacareorder everyone health insurance have government help some them view Republicans should make universal coverage their goalbut declare that they will achieve through incentives rather than topdown commands this they would cede Democrats moral high ground aiming universal coverage would instead give laboratory real world opportunity demonstrate effectiveness their ideas Republicans succeed overcoming these obstacles pass reconciliation package that will move country away from Obamacare toward system credits reformed Medicaid system Even that doesnt happen they certain make some progress phase rewriting reforming heavyhanded Obamaera regulations This phase does require congressional input Trump administration will have more latitude maneuver will have carte blanche however Regulatory efforts governed Administrative Procedures abiding acts provisions takes timeand every change procedure will subject court challenges This means will take years before know close
