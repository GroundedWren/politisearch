Unblock Follow Following Father partner Seattle graphic designer deeply curious about justice equality Intolerant Liberals There cult ignorance United States there always been strain been constant thread winding through political cultural life nurtured false notion that democracy means that ignorance just good your knowledge IsaacAsimov Nicholas Kristof whom fond recently wrote article that argues that Liberals intolerant because there arent many Christians conservatives teaching universities There much exhausted about right this article connects much with several thoughts that have been swirling around soul They mostly have with false equivalency relativism lighting Growing conservative Christian warned about secular liberal relativism Nothings really knows relative careful about such slippery slopes After gays into such poor logic then would come goats then children then Satan worship would follow turns that this sort relativism entirely myth right only people ever implore relative logic this sort crass level conservatives Trying play gotcha with liberals exhausting have some difficult news everyone Progressives arent interested diversity arent interested inclusion arent interested tolerance progressives know give exactly zero shits about those things have interest everyone getting treated same have interest giving ideas equal airtime have interest tolerating beliefs dont know where this fairy tale comes from completely disconnected from every experience with progressive liberal folks lifetime When conservatives cross their arms glare shout fair Youre supposed welcome everyone arent being nice stings about much they shouted fair youre supposed wearing tutus juggling flaming donuts progressive liberal agenda isnt about being nice about confronting evil violence trauma death about acknowledging ways systemic power systemic oppression systemic evil work world around fighting diversity fighting tolerance fighting overturn horrific systems dehumanizing oppression Heres great example liberal relationship diversity when Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked many women Supreme Court would enough answered When there nine response collective gasp every conservative earth elaborated most countrys history there were nine they were Nobody thought that strange Personally interested female president sake diversity Putting woman white house wont mean that gender equality arrived Weve presidents going take women serving president before even have chance reach parity want pretend that racial gender horror world already been righted righted almost righted hope come close being righted your lifetime female presidents youre getting picture have collective buildup hundreds thousands years injustice metabolize What Were Actually Confronting Take facts race White America exhausted Blacks invoking yearold history excuse their problems Theyve just like whites since Emancipation Proclamation since since Obama made into office Lets pause this live Seattle Washington liberal city there ever Full cheery whites with Black Lives Matter signs their windows Seattle Washington black residents make less money than white ones less less average black Seattlites income less than half average white Seattleites income Less than half either there unspoken forces play that make twice hard black people Seattle earn money black people exactly half intelligent hardworking white folks Take your pick honest about which youre choosing Hows country whole Well average white families have more wealth than black families much more like Seattles income disparity White families average have wealth black families much progress have made racial equality America Well apparently were there Only more have fouryearold white black same income bracket same level education will live onaverage years less than Half decade Mysteriously That same black higher chance spending time prison than much higher rate rate Nope likely imprisoned Empowering Oppressed worried that enough Christian professors getting hired universities Every single president this country been Christian Every Single President Barack Obamas presidency means that about times easier become president youre white than black still infinitely easier president United States youre Christian House Senate Christians throwing rock either building hitting Christian When your religion represented every President history governing body that rules your land youre doing okay whole representation thing When conservative politicians have control White House Senate House country with most economic military power history planet think crying persecution conservatives might suspect crying persecution what conservatives with every single step towards gender equality racial equality movement that seeks treat humans with same dignity currently conferred white conservatives definition their rights that people allowed married Latinx people allowed live same code false equivalency straight white Christian mens feelings with everyone elses lives absurd Poor Nazi soldiers getting rounded into prisoner camps while those Jewish people getting prisons same Allied soldiers Jewish people preferential treatment Furthermore conservative Christians have allied themselves with racism misogyny homophobia Islamophobia mass incarceration crimes death sentences culture These Christians work actively undermine scientific thinking Antievolution antiglobal warming antifactual None these line with values most universities share important intellectual growth have variety important that unpopular ideas hearing important there debate changes heart allow sincere disagreements continue wrestle with another clarification have interest universities being populated people think like have interest them being populated with people think world views inherently equal Conservative thinking definition bent conserving status often regressive shrinking backward movement return previous points cultural political intellectual development Universities arent bereft conservatives Evangelicals because vast leftwing conspiracy Theyre bereft those people because people committed those world views rarely have anything offer openminded inquiring growing community Universities lacking conservatives fundamentalist Christians because amount education that takes become professor likely expose Evangelicals conservatives enough good ideas that theyre longer fundamentalist conservative fact that humanities departments exceptionally lacking conservatives dogmatically religious people highlights this reality Psychology poetry sociology political science People have wrestled with human condition human soul literature least likely give credence backwards ideas that diminishing human value human dignity Lefts DoubleStandard When liberals storm cities streets protest rally riot response Trump election conservatives They doublestandard Liberals expect conservatives accept election results they dont like wont liberals accept election results that didnt their favor wont liberals relativists like want them treat outcomes equally valid Because political decisions arent equally right Arent equally moral Arent equally recognizing human dignity justice freedom Because liberals recognize that there wrong right decisions because they parse good evil contrary what church taught about them Because democracy isnt only value hold dont accept enslaving popular vote believe human rights believe Bill Rights Because balance will people with sanctity each individual life your right sell flowers doesnt outweigh someone elses right married Because rights equal Because Hitler brought power democratically elected government Because American slavery legal Right also willing confront government with action more direct than voting holing themselves with assault rifles maintain unpaid access grazing public lands just because government might seize those assault rifles government takes guns well have stopping government from taking guns Left meanwhile roaring streets about countless deaths unarmed black Americans people charged with keeping them safe Roaring streets about environmental devastation that smartest humans among agree poses threat human life Roaring streets about admitted sexual predator being appointed administer over nations federal enforcement Conservatives having taken streets riot when Obama elected doesnt prevent from taking streets direct much resistance Trump humanly possible Because Trump Obama arent equal Conservatives being deeply outraged fearful when Obama elected doesnt negate somehow counterbalance outrage fear Left right Because Right afraid ridiculous imagined fantasie times persecution wildly inaccurate information When primary source terror living under Obama administration that Muslim dont have ounce sympathy from Meanwhile Left dealing with Donald Trumps actually announced commit crimes imprison political

political innocence Here last were free inscribe their aspirations society without clog corruption accumulated evils history beginning Locke world America This course overstatement since American could escape history brought with from Europe more than could escape peculiar stamp American experience especially everreceding frontier though extreme view entirely misleading American tabula rasa have been totally blank lacked determining phenomenon particular European scene that feudalism young American political scientist Professor Louis Hartz Harvard brilliantly argued recent book Liberal Tradition America absence feudalism abasic factor accounting pervasive liberalism American political climate absence feudalism meant absence static confining social order meant equally absence profound social passion uproot destroy that order deprived America simultaneously traditions reaction revolution American Revolution thus revolution limited liability aiming national independence more than social change since independence American political conflict taken place atmosphere sometimes felt rather than understood consensus tensions French Revolution still vibrate Fourth Republic Thomas Jefferson could dispel most apprehensions Glorious Revolution proclaiming inaugural Republicans Federalists There have been periods more embittered political feeling America than Andrew Jackson Tocqueville seeing America perspective France couldnot feel differences between Jacksonians Whigs superficial trivial American historians have always drawn mellow picture American political history these historians Hartz argues with some justice have often ignored framework consensus their zest conflict American campaign oratory Hartz warns should never taken sober description issues American partisan enthusiasm gives violence sham battles which observer would nonetheless sadly mistaken takes loutrance verbal violence underlying accord further helpsexplain semantic obscurity American politics Every mood another claimed liberal conservative even Franklin Roosevelt conservative even Herbert Hoover liberal Such words American consensus tend counters game rather than symbols impassable divisions principle this point Hartz surely right American political tradition essentially based liberal consensus Even those Americans privately reject liberal tradition like Communists McCarthyites succeed only they profess relationship liberalism They wither liberal society when their antiliberal purposes fully exposed understood this invocation consensus does perhaps tell whole story historians American past much terms conflict there danger that historians political scientists today past much terms agreement however much Americans have united fundamentals there still remain sharp significant differences differences which divided Jefferson from Hamilton Jackson from Daniel Webster William Jennings Bryan from McKinley Franklin Roosevelt from Hoover have those been local fleeting differences Rather they have been differences which time given sense continuity that identifiable traditions have emerged American politics liberal tradition least been animated vigorous sense each period that bearer cause which stretches back Jefferson beginning Republic conflict within liberal consensus between liberalism conservatism been sources creativity advance American history account American politics which leaves impoverishes distorts American past words like liberalism conservatism immediately raises questions definition absence feudal tradition course gravely affected character American conservatism deprived American conservatism instinct responsible well instinct kill both decorum terror reducing whole expressions rather ejaculations individual class selfinterest recent years school Conservatives sought rehabilitate tradition American conservatism since many Conservatives take positions immediate issues which closer views American liberals than American conservatives semantic confusion only been compounded Accepting theory America essentially liberal society distinguish liberal conservative tendencies within that society Some Conservatives tell that liberal believes perfectibility while conservative conviction human fallibility original preached more effectively this generation reality human imperfection than liberal politics least Reinhold Niebuhr while Andrew Carnegie conservative used that there conceivable march perfection would hard argue example that words Dwight Eisenhower conservative show greater sense frailty human striving tragedy human condition than those liberal Adlai Stevenson Similarly difficult believe that crucial distinction lies attitude toward role state Thus conservatives Alexander Hamilton John Quincy Adams liberal Franklin Roosevelt agreed advocating government direction economy while liberal Thomas Jefferson conservative Herbert Hoover agreed wishing limit power state does distinction question civil freedom Some liberals have been majoritarians with limited concern rights minorities some conservatives have been valiant defenders liberties conscience expression does even really question private property While conservatives have been more vigilant champions private property liberals have perhaps stood more consistently rights property Lockes original sense product nature with which mixes labor this ambiguity even position testify once again absence deep differences principle American society Each great half wrote Emerson liberal conservative impossible whole Each exposes abuses other true society true both must combine elaborating character each great half Emerson went define diverging tendencies which liberalism conservatism have embodied within American consensus distinction think still useful today Emerson basic difference between party past party future between party memory party hope still true that American liberal believes that society should improved that improve apply human intelligence social economic problems conservative other hand opposes efforts purposeful change especially when they threaten existing distribution power wealth because believes that things about good they reasonably expected that change more likely than worse liberal belief working change does mean that regards human reason infallible incorruptible instrument that thinks utopia just around corner does mean that feels that history never stands still that social change better quality peoples lives happiness that margin human gain however limited worth effort will conservative cases occasions resist change inclines accept only when intellectual case overwhelming political pressure irresistible that point clings stubbornly that which knows which habituated castle which conservatism defend said Emerson actual state things good Enough should have been said indicate that liberalism American usage little common with word used politics European country save possibly Britain Liberalism America been party social progress rather than intellectual doctrine committed ends rather than methods When laissezfaire policy seemed best calculated achieve liberal objective equality opportunity time Jefferson liberals believed Jeffersonian phrase that that government best which governs least when growing complexity industrial conditions required increasing government intervention order assure more equal opportunities liberal tradition faithful goal rather than dogma altered view state process redefining liberalism terms social needs century conducted Theodore

indirect controls fiscal monetary policy rather than direct physical quantitative controls Veblen type persuaded American liberalism that central economic management reconciled with decision technical advantages price system free market broad liberal objective balanced flexible mixed economy thus seeking occupy that middle ground between capitalism socialism whose viability long been denied both capitalists socialists American liberalism should emphasized antisocialist where socialism retains classical connotation state ownership basic means production distribution This partly because American liberals doubt whether bases political opposition freedom survive when power vested state liberty guaranteed anything selfrestraint rulers must have resources inaccessible state antisocialism American liberals derives also from estimate administrative difficulties socialist system substantial abundance equality opportunity achieved through system mixed enterprise throw rigid oppressive structure state bureaucracy humane distinct from institutional goals socialism better achieved American liberals feel through diversifying ownership rather than concentrating American liberalism

followup both Misess devastating book showing that socialism would fail Economic Calculation Socialist Commonwealth book criticizing written address burning question socialism fascism what form social arrangement most conducive human flourishing Misess answer summed title liberalism Even these times Mises aware that meaning liberalism changed from common century clarify that understanding only included commercial freedom rooted Without economic freedom other form freedom have material meaning Mises accept idea that term been merely stolen from proponents free markets thought never been worked scientifically therefore theory liberalism became vulnerable political manipulation Thus Mises more than restate doctrine gave thoroughly modern defense freedom that corrected errors liberal school rooting idea liberty institution private property subject which classical school sometimes unclear That grand contribution this volume program liberalism therefore condensed into single word would have read property that private ownership means production other demands liberalism result from this fundamental demand there other insights demonstrates that order inherent free society stems from mystical source from capacity price system provide means rational coordination between independent actors This rational pursuit individual interest leads division labor development money economy

means peace political liberty religion recommends complete separation church state cultural conviction that favors tolerance immigration favors freedom movement education state involvement must completely some ways this most political Misess treatises also most inspiring books ever written idea liberty remains book that world fire freedom which probably been translated into more than dozen languages concluding message here something that every freedom lover needs contemplate return again again Consider words very seriously Liberalism religion worldview party special interests religion

through dozen times always find something something inspiring something that provides intellectual guidance Mises what happening Europe what could happen United States dangers before they truly arrived frame make statement ages accomplished this This book singular statement that might ever displaced Preface Bettina Bien Greaves term liberalism from Latin liber meaning free referred originally philosophy freedom still retained this meaning Europe when this book written that readers opened covers expected analysis freedom philosophy classical liberalism Unfortunately however recent decades liberalism come mean something very different word been taken over especially United States philosophical socialists used them refer their government intervention welfare state programs example among many possible ones former Senator Joseph Clark when Mayor Philadelphia described modern liberal position very frankly these words ghost outset dismiss semantics liberal here defined believes utilizing full force government advancement social political economic justice municipal state national international levels liberal believes government proper tool development society which attempts carry Christian principles conduct into practical effect Atlantic July This view liberalism prevalent when English translation this book appeared that Mises believed then that translate literally original title Liberalismus would confusing called English version Free Prosperous Commonwealth following year however Mises decided that advocates freedom free markets should relinquish liberalism philosophical socialists Prefaces both second third editions magnum opus Human Action Mises wrote that advocates freedom philosophy should reclaim term liberal because there simply other term available signify great political intellectual movement that ushered modern civilization fostering free market economy limited government individual freedom this sense that liberalism used throughout this book benefit readers familiar with works Ludwig Mises decades leading spokesman Austrian school economics named because Mises well prominent Menger Eugen Böehm Bawerkwere Austrian born cornerstone Austrian school subjective value marginal utility theory This theory traces economic phenomena simple complex actions individuals each undertaken result personal subjective values basis this subjective value theory Mises explained analyzed methodology value action prices markets money monopoly government intervention economic booms busts making especially significant contributions fields money economic calculation Mises earned doctorate from University Vienna thesis Theory Money Credit published German English first many theoretical works economics During interwar years addition writing articles books such powerful treatise Socialism Mises worked full time Austrian Chamber Commerce economic adviser Austrian government taught part time Private Dozent lecturer University Vienna also conducted private economics seminar scholars many whom became influential worldwide established private Austrian Institute Business Cycle Research which still survives After Hitler came power Germany Mises anticipated trouble Austria took position Switzerland with Graduate Institute International Studies While there Although there were German readers this monumental

personal sphere torch which Mises have lighted become guide movement freedom which gathering strength every leading students United States Professor Israel Kirzner York University described impact modern students ferment sense excitement evident resurgence interest this Austrian perspective Misess contributions have been crucial decisive Mises always careful logical theoretician only ivory tower theoretician Driven logic scientific reasoning conclusion that liberal society with free markets only road domestic international peace harmony felt compelled apply economic theories expounded government policy Liberalism Mises only offers brief explanations many important economic phenomena also presents more explicitly than other books views government very limited essential role preserving social cooperation under which free market function Mises views still appear fresh modern readers will find analysis pertinent Mises message that ideas rule world runs constant refrain throughout books comes through especially strong Liberalism ultimate outcome struggle between liberalism wrote will decided arms ideas ideas that group into fighting factions that press weapons into their hands that determine against whom whom weapons shall used they alone arms that last analysis turn scales fact only hope keeping world from plunging still further into international chaos conflict convince people abandon government intervention adopt liberal policies Bettina Bien Greaves Foundation Economic Education August Foreword Louis Spadaro importance this little book greater believe than would expect from modest size unpretentious language very simply book about free society about what would nowadays termed policy implications such society conduct both internal external affairs very especially about some obstacles problems whether real imagined lying establishing maintaining that form social organization while there nothing extraordinary this surprising fact that virtually none those have advocated some alternative form social economic organization offered similar discussion their respective proposals Even growing band writers regale with detailed criticisms capitalism with forecasts impending demise strangely reticent treating contradictions other difficulties that might occur operation system they prefer predict significance this omission however easily been brushed aside only because responsibility usually somewhat misplaced accuse Marxto take most frequent exampleof failure describe operating details implications socialist society Kapital indefensible that work exactly what intended highly critical examination workings capitalism Marx conceived latter would just vacuous accuse Mises neglecting include Socialism discussion principles enterprise system essential point that Mises address himself just such task separate bookthis onewheras Marx never This then book which Marx failed write which followers other critics liberalism also neglected real importance this book however found this narrower more polemical sense much more fundamental constructive Despite brevity this essay manages speak fairly large number questions doubts confusions most people face course making their minds economic issues particular merit that questions taken Mises provides insights alternative views that sure useful Since reader will surely want proceed once examine consider some these shall intrude with comments except irrepressible reflections with which this foreword will close Instead shall next take sampling those questions opinions commonly minds people considering controversial issues which Mises things here that worth taking into account convenience these listed more less order which reference them occurs text free market system been full operation over long time proved unworkable Liberalism suffers from fixation desirability increasing production material wellbeing persistently overlooks mans spiritual needs Since people dont always perfectly rationally might better some issues less reliance strictly logical arguments trust more intuitions impulses socalled feelings There denying that capitalism essentially system that structured favor rich propertied people expense other classes defend social system that does enable each every individual realize what dreams achieve everything works private ownership means production obsolete piece excess baggage carried over from earlier periods people find difficult accept accommodate changed conditions very nature doesnt competitive market economy best tend work against international peace worst actually promote wars What possible defense there socioeconomic system that produces such great inequalities income consumption Pragmatism aside there morally defensible justification private property rights opposing government interventions liberalism implicitly bound advocate some form anarchy selfevident that stable democratic society more possible under system decentralized planning decisionmaking than under centrally planned economy What reason there expect that capitalist Society will necessarily more tolerant dissension than socialist Capitalism creates preserves preferential position leisure class resource owners work contribute significant society reason institution private property survived long that been protected state indeed Marx argued preservation private property only function state argument that socialism cannot work itself because lacks means making required economic calculations interesting there specific concrete illustrations this Also interesting suggestion that government interventions operation private enterprise necessarily lead distortions therefore selfdefeating shown specific example that this necessarily case Apart from arguing that alternative proposed systems shown inferior there direct positive reasons advocating freeenterprise system Since order workable enterprise system requires large number relatively small firms very active competition with each other been rendered largely obsolete development giant corporations monopolies like Inasmuch managements large corporations tend develop into bureaucracies isnt issue private versus public control largely distinction without difference coordination between domestic foreign policies more feasible consistent under liberalism than under some other system Isnt existence protection rights private ownership hindrance rather than help achieving maintaining international peace understanding seems obvious that nationalism colonialism imperialism could have evolved only under capitalism selfinterest private enterprises main impediment developing freer movement goods people among worlds regions Since represents fosters special interests classthe resource owners made serious tactical blunder constituting itself political party pursuing aims through compromise accordance with political expediency Anyone been position observe close range certain halftruths seemingly selfevident values often prevent people from giving full fair considerations unfamiliar unfashionable views economics will recognize many points mentioned this list What Mises each these should help general reader beginning student toward more comprehensive perspective social issues also deal with doubts suspicions suppression book East Germany which Mises refers preface becomes understandable this light another importance Finally there points which should like make some brief comment first which occurs number times book such very different contexts apart that generality importance noticed This ideaso essential logic true liberalism that often wise productive make what Mises place calls provisional sacrifices claim immediate benefit however attractive seem folly doing shuts greater later benefit that much greater that more than makes both forgoing present gain trouble waiting course reasonable people making this sort calculation would likely choose present benefit under conditions stipulated Butand this heart sometimes calculate prudently they encouraged same type omission occurs under very different circumstances from being true only ordinary citizen consumer apply businessmen their pursuit shortrun profits competitive advantage legislator favors immediate increase minimumwage rates social security benefits tariffs other

other parts inhabited world well Nowhere this program ever completely carried Even England which been called homeland liberalism model liberal country proponents liberal policies never succeeded

world once lived through liberal Liberalism never permitted come full fruition Nevertheless brief limited supremacy liberal ideas sufficed change face earth magnificent economic development took place

contrary application teachings science social life just economics sociology philosophy have stood still since days David Hume Adam Smith David Ricardo Jeremy Bentham Wilhelm Humboldt doctrine liberalism different today from what their even though fundamental principles have remained unchanged many years undertaken present concise statement essential meaning that doctrine This serve justify present attempt providing just such work Material Welfare Liberalism doctrine directed entirely towards conduct this world last analysis nothing else view than advancement their outward material welfare does concern itself directly with their inner spiritual metaphysical needs does promise happiness contentment only most abundant possible satisfaction those desires that satisfied things outer world Liberalism often been reproached this purely external materialistic attitude toward what earthly transitory life said does consist eating drinking There higher more important needs than food drink shelter clothing Even greatest earthly riches cannot give happiness they leave inner self soul unsatisfied empty most serious error liberalism been that nothing offer mans deeper nobler aspirations critics speak this vein show only that they have very imperfect materialistic conception these higher nobler needs Social policy with means that disposal make rich poor never succeed making them happy satisfying their inmost yearnings Here external expedients fail that social policy remove outer causes pain suffering further system that feeds hungry clothes naked houses homeless Happiness contentment depend food clothing shelter above what cherishes within himself from disdain spiritual goods that liberalism concerns itself exclusively with mans material wellbeing from conviction that what highest deepest cannot touched outward regulation seeks produce only outer wellbeing because knows that inner spiritual riches cannot come from without only from within heart does creating anything outward preconditions development inner life there doubt that relatively prosperous individual twentieth century more readily satisfy spiritual needs than individual tenth century

examination given conditions that that raises above animals owes reason should forgo reason just sphere social policy trust vague obscure feelings impulses Liberalism There widespread opinion that liberalism distinguished from other political movements fact that places interests part societythe propertied classes capitalists interests other classes This assertion completely mistaken Liberalism always view good whole that special group this that English utilitarians meant true very aptlyin their famous formula greatest happiness greatest number Historically liberalism first political movement that aimed promoting welfare that special groups Liberalism distinguished from socialism which likewise professes strive good goal which aims means that chooses attain that goal maintained that consequence liberal policy must favor special interests certain strata society this still question that allows discussion tasks present work show that such reproach justified cannot from very outset impute unfairness person raises itthough consider opinion incorrect could very well advanced best faith case whoever attacks liberalism this concedes that intentions disinterested that wants nothing what says wants Quite different those critics liberalism reproach wanting promote general welfare only special interests certain classes Such critics both unfair ignorant choosing this mode attack they show that they inwardly well aware weakness their case They snatch poisoned weapons because they cannot otherwise hope success doctor shows patient craves food detrimental health perversity desire will foolish doctor does care good patient whoever wishes patient well must grudge enjoyment relishing such delicious food Everyone will understand that doctor advises patient forgo pleasure that enjoyment harmful food affords solely order avoid injuring health soon matter concerns social policy prone consider quite differently When liberal advises against certain popular measures because expects harmful consequences from them censured enemy people praise heaped demagogues without consideration harm that will follow recommend what seems expedient moment Reasonable action distinguished from unreasonable action fact that involves provisional sacrifices latter only apparent sacrifices since they outweighed favorable consequences that later ensue person avoids tasty unwholesome food makes merely provisional seeming sacrifice outcomethe nonoccurrence injury healthshows that lost gained this however requires insight into consequences ones action demagogue takes advantage this fact opposes liberal calls provisional merely apparent sacrifices denounces hardhearted enemy people meanwhile setting himself friend humanity supporting measures advocates knows well touch hearts hearers move them tears with allusions want misery Antiliberal policy policy capital consumption recommends that present more abundantly provided expense future exactly same case patient whom have spoken both instances relatively grievous disadvantage future stands opposition relatively abundant momentary gratification talk such case question were versus philanthropy downright dishonest untruthful only common politicians press antiliberal parties that open such reproach Almost writers school have made this underhanded mode combat That there want misery world average newspaper reader dullness only prone believe argument against liberalism precisely want misery that liberalism seeks abolish considers means that proposes only suitable ones achievement this whoever thinks that knows better even different means this adduce proof assertion that liberals strive good members society only that special groups substitute this proof fact that there want misery would constitute argument against liberalism even world today followed liberal policy would always open question whether still more want misery might prevail other policies been followed view ways which functioning institution private property curbed hindered every quarter today antiliberal policies manifestly quite absurd seek infer anything against correctness liberal principles from fact that economic conditions present that could wish order appreciate what liberalism capitalism have accomplished should compare conditions they present with those Middle Ages first centuries modern What liberalism capitalism could have accomplished they been allowed free rein inferred only from theoretical considerations Liberalism Capitalism society which liberal principles into effect usually called capitalist society condition that society capitalism Since economic policy liberalism everywhere been only more less closely approximated practice conditions they world today provide with imperfect idea meaning possible capitalism full flower Nevertheless altogether justified calling capitalism because that created wealth time traced back capitalist institutions thanks those liberal ideas that still remain alive society what survives capitalist system that great mass contemporaries enjoy standard living above that which just generations possible only rich especially privileged sure customary rhetoric demagogues these facts represented quite differently listen them would think that progress techniques production redounds exclusive benefit favored while masses sink ever more deeply into misery However requires only moments reflection realize that fruits technological industrial innovations make improvement satisfaction wants great masses industries that produce consumers goods work directly their benefit industries that produce machines halffinished products work them indirectly great industrial developments last decades like those eighteenth century that designated altogether happily chosen phrase Industrial Revolution have resulted above better satisfaction needs masses development clothing industry mechanization shoe production improvements processing distribution foodstuffs have their very nature benefited widest public thanks these industries that masses today better clothed than ever before However mass production provides only food shelter clothing also other requirements multitude press serves masses quite much motion picture industry even theater similar strongholds arts daily becoming more more places mass entertainment Nevertheless result zealous propaganda antiliberal parties which twists facts other round people today have come associate ideas liberalism capitalism with image world plunged into ever increasing misery poverty sure amount deprecatory propaganda could ever succeed demagogues hoped giving words liberal liberalism completely pejorative connotation last analysis possible brush aside fact that spite efforts antiliberal propaganda there something these expressions that suggests what every normal person feels when hears word freedom Antiliberal propaganda therefore avoids mentioning word liberalism often prefers infamies that attributes liberal system associated with term capitalism That word brings mind flinthearted capitalist thinks nothing enrichment even that possible only through exploitation fellow hardly occurs anyone when forms notion capitalist that social order organized genuinely liberal principles constituted leave entrepreneurs capitalists only wealth better providing their fellow with what they themselves think they need Instead speaking capitalism connection with prodigious improvement standard living masses antiliberal propaganda mentions capitalism only referring those phenomena whose emergence made possible solely because restraints that were imposed upon liberalism reference made fact that capitalism placed delectable luxury well food form sugar disposal great masses Capitalism mentioned connection with sugar only when price sugar country raised above world market price cartel such development were even conceivable social order which liberal principles were into effect country with liberal regime which there tariffs cartels capable driving price commodity above world market price would quite unthinkable links chain reasoning which antiliberal demagogy succeeds laying upon liberalism capitalism blame excesses evil consequences antiliberal policies follows starts from assumption that liberal principles promoting interests capitalists entrepreneurs expense interests rest population that liberalism policy that favors rich over poor Then observes that many entrepreneurs capitalists under certain conditions advocate protective tariffs still othersthe armaments policy national preparedness hand jumps conclusion that these must capitalistic policies fact however case quite otherwise Liberalism policy interest particular group policy interest mankind therefore incorrect assert that entrepreneurs capitalists have special interest supporting liberalism Their interest championing liberal program exactly same that everyone else There individual cases which some entrepreneurs capitalists cloak their special interests program liberalism opposed these always special interests other entrepreneurs capitalists matter quite simple those everywhere scent interests interested parties imagine That nation imposes tariff iron example cannot simply explained fact that this benefits iron magnates There also persons with opposing interests country even among entrepreneurs case beneficiaries tariff iron steadily diminishing minority bribery explanation people bribed likewise only minority besides does only group protectionists bribing their opponents freetraders fact that ideology that makes protective tariff possible created neither interested parties those bribed them ideologists give world ideas that direct course human affairs which antiliberal ideas prevail virtually everyone thinks accordingly just hundred years most people thought terms then prevailing liberal ideology many entrepreneurs today advocate protective tariffs this nothing more than form that antiliberalism takes their case nothing with liberalism Psychological Roots Antiliberalism cannot task this book discuss problem social cooperation otherwise than with rational arguments root opposition liberalism cannot reached resort method reason This opposition does stem from reason from pathological mental attitudefrom resentment from neurasthenic condition that might call Fourier complex after French socialist that name Concerning resentment envious malevolence little need said Resentment work when hates somebody more favorable circumstances that prepared bear heavy losses only hated might also come harm Many those attack capitalism know very well that their situation under other economic system will less favorable Nevertheless with full knowledge this fact they advocate reform socialism because they hope that rich whom they envy will also suffer under Time again hears socialists that even material want will easier bear socialist society because people will realize that better than neighbor events resentment still dealt with rational arguments after difficult make clear person filled with resentment that important thing cannot

workable system human cooperation society based division labor private ownership means production They contend that socialism completely comprehensive system encompassing means production unworkable that application socialist principle part means production though course impossible leads reduction productivity labor that from creating greater wealth must contrary have effect diminishing wealth program liberalism therefore condensed into single word would have read property that private ownership means production regard commodities ready consumption private ownership matter course disputed even socialists communists other demands liberalism result from this fundamental demand Side side with word property program liberalism quite appropriately place words freedom peace This because older program liberalism generally placed them there have already said that program presentday liberalism outgrown that older liberalism that based deeper better insight into since reap benefit advances that science made last decades Freedom peace have been placed forefront program liberalism because many older liberals regarded them coordinate with fundamental principle liberalism itself rather than merely necessary consequence following from fundamental principle private ownership means production solely because freedom peace have come under especially violent attack from opponents liberalism liberals have wanted give appearance through omission these principles that they acknowledged justness objections raised against them Freedom idea freedom become ingrained that long time dared call into question People were accustomed always speaking freedom only with greatest reverence remained Lenin call bourgeois prejudice Although fact often forgotten today this achievement liberalism very name liberalism derived from freedom name party opposition liberals both designations arose Spanish constitutional struggles first decades nineteenth century originally servile Before rise liberalism even highminded philosophers founders religions clerics animated best intentions statesmen genuinely loved their people viewed thralldom part human race just generally useful downright beneficial institution Some peoples thought destined nature freedom others bondage only masters thought greater number slaves well They with their servitude only because they yield superior force masters also because they found some good slave relieved concern securing daily bread master obliged provide with necessities life When liberalism eighteenth first half nineteenth century abolish serfdom subjection peasant population Europe slavery Negroes overseas colonies sincere humanitarians declared themselves opposition Unfree laborers used their bondage feel evil They ready freedom would know make masters care would very harmful them They would capable managing their affairs such always provide more than just bare necessities life they would soon fall into want misery Emancipation would thus only fail gain them anything real value would seriously impair their material wellbeing What astonishing that could hear these views expressed even many slaves whom questioned order counter such opinions many liberals believed necessary represent general rule even occasion depict exaggerated manner exceptional cases which serfs slaves been cruelly abused these excesses were means rule There were course isolated instances abuse fact that there were such cases additional reason abolition this system rule however treatment bondsmen their masters humane mild When those recommended abolition involuntary servitude general humanitarian grounds were told that retention system also interest enslaved they knew nothing rejoinder against this objection favor slavery there only argument that refute othersnamely that free labor incomparably more productive than slave labor slave interest exerting himself fully works only much zealously necessary escape punishment attaching failure perform minimum free worker other hand knows that more labor accomplishes more will paid exerts himself full order raise income only compare demands placed worker tending modern tractor with relatively small expenditure intelligence strength industry that just generations deemed sufficient enthralled ploughmen Russia Only free labor accomplish what must demanded modern industrial worker Muddleheaded babblers therefore argue interminably over whether destined freedom ready They contending that there races peoples whom Nature prescribed life servitude that master races have duty keeping rest mankind bondage liberal will oppose their arguments because reasoning favor freedom without distinction entirely different kind liberals assert that Nature meant free because instructed designs Nature avoid principle drawing Nature into dispute over mundane questions What maintain only that system based freedom workers warrants greatest productivity human labor therefore interest inhabitants earth attack involuntary servitude spite fact that advantageous masters because convinced that last analysis hurts interests members human society including masters mankind adhered practice keeping whole even part labor force bondage magnificent economic developments last hundred fifty years would have been possible would have railroads automobiles airplanes steamships electric light power chemical industry just ancient Greeks Romans with their genius were without these things suffices merely mention this everyone realize that even former masters slaves serfs have every reason satisfied with course events after abolition involuntary servitude European worker today lives under more favorable more agreeable outward circumstances than pharaoh Egypt once spite fact that pharaoh commanded thousands slaves while worker nothing depend strength skill hands nabob yore could placed circumstances which common lives today would declare without hesitation that life been beggarly comparison with life that even moderate means lead present This fruit free labor able create more wealth everyone than slave labor once provided masters Peace There highminded detest because brings death suffering However much admire their their argument against being based philanthropic grounds seems lose much force when consider statements supporters proponents latter means deny that brings with pain sorrow Nevertheless they believe through alone that mankind able make progress father things said Greek philosopher thousands have repeated after degenerates time peace Only awakens slumbering talents powers imbues with sublime ideals were abolished mankind would decay into indolence stagnation difficult even impossible refute this line reasoning part advocates only objection that think that demands sacrifices proponents opinion that these sacrifices made vain that they well worth making were really true that father things then human sacrifices requires would necessary further general welfare progress humanity might lament sacrifices might even strive reduce their number would warranted wanting abolish bring about eternal peace liberal critique argument favor fundamentally different from that humanitarians starts from premise that peace father things What alone enables mankind advance distinguishes from animals social cooperation labor alone that productive creates wealth therewith lays outward foundations inward flowering only destroys cannot create carnage destruction devastation have common with predatory beasts jungle constructive labor distinctively human characteristic liberal abhors like humanitarian spite fact that beneficial consequences because only harmful ones peaceloving humanitarian approaches mighty potentate addresses thus make even though have prospect furthering your welfare victory noble magnanimous renounce tempting victory even means sacrifice loss advantage liberal thinks otherwise convinced that victorious evil even victor that peace always better than demands sacrifice from stronger only that should come realize where true interests should learn understand that peace stronger just advantageous weaker When peaceloving nation attacked bellicose enemy must offer resistance everything ward onslaught Heroic deeds performed such those fighting their freedom their lives entirely praiseworthy rightly extols manliness courage such fighters Here daring intrepidity contempt death praiseworthy because they service good people have made mistake representing these soldierly virtues absolute virtues qualities good themselves without consideration they serve Whoever holds this opinion must consistent likewise acknowledge noble virtues daring intrepidity contempt death robber fact however there nothing good itself Human actions become good only through that they serve consequences they entail Even Leonidas would worthy esteem which hold fallen defender homeland leader invading army intent robbing peaceful people freedom possessions harmful development human civilization becomes clearly apparent once understands advantages derived from division labor division labor turns selfsufficient individual into dependent fellow social animal which Aristotle spoke Hostilities between animal another between savage another alter economic basis their existence matter quite different when quarrel that decided appeal arms breaks among members community which labor divided such society each individual specialized function longer position live independently because have need anothers support Selfsufficient farmers produce their farms everything that they their families need make another when village divides into factions with smith side shoemaker other faction will have suffer from want shoes other from want tools weapons Civil destroys division labor inasmuch compels each group content itself with labor adherents possibility such hostilities been considered likely first place division labor would never have been allowed develop point where case fight really break would have suffer privation progressive division labor possible only society which there assurance lasting peace Only under shelter such security division labor develop absence this prerequisite division labor does extend beyond limits village even individual household division labor between town countrywith peasants surrounding villages furnishing grain cattle milk butter town exchange manufactured products presupposes that peace assured least within region question division labor embrace whole nation civil must outside realm possibility encompass whole world lasting peace among nations must assured Everyone today would regard utterly senseless modern metropolis like London Berlin prepare make inhabitants adjacent countryside many centuries towns Europe kept this possibility mind made economic provision There were towns whose fortifications were from very beginning constructed that case need they could hold while keeping cattle growing grain within town walls beginning nineteenth century greater part inhabited world still divided into number economic regions that were large selfsufficient Even more highly developed areas Europe needs region were most part production region itself Trade that went beyond narrow confines immediate vicinity relatively insignificant comprised large only such commodities could produced area itself because climatic conditions greater part world however production village itself supplied almost needs inhabitants these villagers disturbance trade relations caused generally mean impairment their economic wellbeing even inhabitants more advanced countries Europe suffer very severely time Continental System which Napoleon imposed Europe order exclude from

longer took seriously idea that great could ever again break golden liberalism among members white race generally considered thing past events have turned quite differently Liberal ideas programs were supplanted socialism nationalism protectionism imperialism etatism militarism Whereas Kant Humboldt Bentham Cobden sung praises eternal peace spokesmen later never tired extolling both civil international their success came only soon result World which given kind object lesson between division labor Equality Nowhere difference between reasoning older liberalism that neoliberalism clearer easier demonstrate than their treatment problem equality liberals eighteenth century guided ideas natural Enlightenment demanded everyone equality political civil rights because they assumed that equal created equal endowing them with fundamentally same capabilities talents breathing into them breath spirit distinctions between only artificial product social humanthat What imperishable manhis

marked differences physical mental attributes Nature never repeats itself creations produces nothing dozen products standardized Each leaves workshop bears imprint individual unique nevertorecur equal demand equality under means grounded contention that equal treatment equals There distinct reasons should receive equal treatment under already mentioned when analyzed objections involuntary servitude order human labor realize highest attainable productivity worker must free because only free worker enjoying form wages fruits industry will exert himself full second consideration favor equality under maintenance social peace already been pointed that every disturbance peaceful development division labor must avoided wellnigh impossible preserve lasting peace society which rights duties respective classes different Whoever denies rights part population must always prepared united attack privileged Class privileges must disappear that conflict over them cease therefore quite unjustifiable find fault with manner which liberalism into effect postulate equality ground that what created only equality before real equality human power would insufficient make really equal will always remain unequal sober considerations utility such those have here presented that constitute argument favor equality under Liberalism never aimed anything more than this could anything more beyond human power make Negro white Negro granted same rights white thereby offered possibility earning much produces much socialists enough make equal before order make them really equal must also allot them same income enough abolish privileges birth rank must finish away with greatest most important privilege namely that which accorded private property Only then will liberal program completely realized consistent liberalism thus leads ultimately socialism abolition private ownership means production Privilege institutional arrangement favoring some individuals certain group expense rest privilege exists although harms someperhaps majorityand benefits except those whose advantage created feudal order Middle Ages certain lords hereditary right hold judgeship They were judges because they inherited position regardless whether they possessed abilities qualities character that judge their eyes this office nothing more than lucrative source income Here judgeship privilege class noble birth however modern states judges always drawn from circle those with legal knowledge experience this does constitute privilege favor lawyers Preference given lawyers their sake sake public welfare because people generally opinion that knowledge jurisprudence indispensable prerequisite holding judgeship question whether certain institutional arrangement regarded privilege granted certain group class person decided whether advantageous that group class person according beneficial general public considered fact that ship captain rest constitute crew subject command certainly advantage captain Nevertheless privilege captain possesses ability steer ship between reefs storm thereby service only himself whole crew order determine whether institutional arrangement regarded special privilege individual class question should whether benefits this that individual class only whether beneficial general public reach conclusion that only private ownership means production makes possible prosperous development human society clear that this tantamount saying that private property privilege property owner social institution good benefit even though same time especially agreeable advantageous some behalf property owners that liberalism favors preservation institution private property because abolition that institution would violate property rights that liberals want preserve they considered abolition institution private property general interest they would advocate that abolished matter prejudicial such policy might interests property owners However preservation that institution interest strata society Even poor call nothing lives incomparably better society than would that would prove incapable producing even fraction what produced Inequality Wealth Income What most criticized social order inequality distribution wealth income There rich poor there very rich very poor seek equal distribution wealth first objection this proposal that will help situation much because those moderate means outnumber rich that each individual could expect from such distribution only quite insignificant increment standard living This certainly correct argument complete Those advocate equality income distribution overlook most important point namely that total available distribution annual product social labor independent manner which divided fact that that product today great natural technological phenomenon independent social conditions entirely result social institutions Only because inequality wealth possible social order only because stimulates everyone produce much lowest cost does mankind today have disposal total annual wealth available consumption Were this incentive destroyed productivity would greatly reduced that portion that equal distribution would allot each individual would less than what even poorest receives today inequality income distribution however still second function quite important already mentioned makes possible luxury rich Many foolish things have been said written about luxury Against luxury consumption been objected that unjust that some should enjoy great abundance while others want This argument seems have some merit only seems shown that luxury consumption performs useful function system social cooperation then argument will proved invalid This however what shall seek demonstrate defense luxury consumption course argument that occasionally hears that that spreads money among people rich indulge themselves luxuries said poor would have income This simply nonsense there were luxury consumption capital labor that would otherwise have been applied production luxury goods would produce other goods articles mass consumption necessary articles instead superfluous ones form correct conception social significance luxury consumption must first realize that concept luxury altogether relative Luxury consists living that stands sharp contrast that great mass ones contemporaries conception luxury therefore essentially historical Many things that seem necessities today were once considered luxuries When Middle Ages aristocratic Byzantine lady married Venetian doge made golden implement which could called forerunner fork know today instead fingers eating meals Venetians looked this godless luxury they thought only just when lady stricken with dreadful disease this must they supposed wellmerited punishment such unnatural extravagance three generations even England indoor bathroom considered luxury today home every English worker better type contains Thirtyfive years there were automobiles twenty years possession such vehicle sign particularly luxurious mode living today United States even worker Ford This course economic history luxury today

luxury visiting foreign countries Schiller never Swiss mountains which celebrated Wilhelm Tell although they bordered Swabian homeland Goethe neither Paris Vienna London Today however hundreds thousands travel soon millions will Private Property Ethics seeking demonstrate social function necessity private ownership means production concomitant inequality distribution income wealth same time providing proof moral justification private property capitalist social order based upon Morality consists regard necessary requirements social existence that must demanded each individual member society living isolation moral rules follow need have qualms about doing anything finds advantage does have consider whether thereby injuring others member society must take into consideration everything does only immediate advantage also necessity every action affirming society such life individual society possible only virtue social cooperation every individual would most seriously harmed social organization life production were break down requiring individual that should take society into consideration actions that should forgo action that while advantageous would detrimental social life society does demand that sacrifice himself interests others sacrifice that imposes only provisional renunciation immediate relatively minor advantage exchange much greater ultimate benefit continued existence society association persons working cooperation sharing common life interest every individual Whoever gives momentary advantage order avoid imperiling continued existence society sacrificing lesser gain greater meaning this regard general social interest frequently been misunderstood moral value believed consist fact sacrifice itself renunciation immediate gratification refused that what morally valuable sacrifice served sacrifice insisted ascribing moral value sacrifice renunciation itself alone sacrificing moral only when serves moral There world difference between risks life property good cause sacrifices them without benefiting society Everything that serves preserve social order moral everything that detrimental immoral Accordingly when reach conclusion that institution beneficial society longer object that immoral There possibly difference opinion about whether particular institution socially beneficial harmful once been judged beneficial longer contend that some inexplicable reason must condemned immoral State Government observance moral ultimate interest every individual because everyone benefits from preservation social cooperation imposes everyone sacrifice even though only provisional that more than greater gain perceive this however requires certain insight into connection between things conform ones actions accordance with this perception demands certain strength will Those lack perception having perception lack necessary will power able conform moral voluntarily situation here different from that involved observance rules hygiene that individual ought follow interest wellbeing Someone give himself over unwholesome dissipation such indulgence narcotics whether because does know consequences because considers them less than renunciation momentary pleasure because lacks requisite will power adjust behavior knowledge There people consider that society justified resorting coercive measures such person right path correct anyone whose heedless actions imperil life health They advocate that alcoholics drug addicts forcibly deterred from indulging their vices compelled protect their good health question whether compulsion really answers purpose such cases shall reserve later consideration What concerns here something quite different namely question whether people whose actions endanger continued existence society should compelled refrain from doing alcoholic drug addict harm only themselves their behavior person violates rules morality governing mans life society harms only himself everyone Life society would quite impossible people desire continued existence conduct themselves accordingly forgo force compulsion against those prepared undermine society their behavior small number antisocial individuals persons willing able make temporary sacrifices that society demands them could make society impossible Without application compulsion coercion against enemies society there could life society call social apparatus compulsion coercion that induces people abide rules life society state rules according which state proceeds organs charged with responsibility administering apparatus compulsion government There sure sect that believes that could quite safely dispense with every form compulsion base society entirely voluntary observance moral code anarchists consider state government superfluous institutions social order that would really serve good just special interests privileged Only because present social order based private ownership means production necessary resort compulsion coercion defense private property were abolished then everyone without exception would spontaneously observe rules demanded social cooperation already been pointed that this doctrine mistaken concerns character private ownership means production even apart from this altogether untenable anarchist rightly enough does deny that every form human cooperation society based division labor demands observance some rules conduct that always agreeable individual since they impose sacrifice only temporary true that least moment painful anarchist mistaken assuming that everyone without exception will willing observe these There dyspeptics though they know very well that indulgence certain food will after short time cause them severe even scarcely bearable pains nevertheless unable forgo enjoyment delectable dish life society easy trace physiological effects food consequences follow quickly above palpably evildoer then assumed without falling completely into absurdity that spite this every individual anarchist society will have greater foresight will power than gluttonous dyspeptic anarchist society possibility entirely excluded that someone negligently throw away lighted match start fire anger jealousy revenge inflict injury fellow Anarchism misunderstands real nature would practicable only world angels saints Liberalism anarchism anything whatsoever with anarchism liberal understands quite clearly that without resort compulsion existence society would endangered that behind rules conduct whose observance necessary assure peaceful human cooperation must stand threat force whole edifice society continually mercy members must position compel person will respect lives health personal freedom private property others acquiesce rules life society This function that liberal doctrine assigns state protection property liberty peace German socialist Ferdinand Lassalle tried make conception government limited exclusively this sphere appear ridiculous calling state constituted basis liberal principles nightwatchman state difficult nightwatchman state should more ridiculous worse than state that concerns itself with preparation sauerkraut with manufacture trouser buttons with publication newspapers order understand impression that Lassalle seeking create with this witticism must keep mind that Germans time forgotten state monarchical despots with vast multiplicity administrative regulatory functions that they were still very much under influence philosophy Hegel which elevated state position divine entity looked upon state with Hegel selfconscious moral substance Universal itself rationality will then course view blasphemous attempt limit function state that serving night watchman only thus that understand possible people reproach liberalism hostility enmity towards state opinion that inexpedient assign government task operating railroads hotels mines enemy state more than called enemy sulfuric acid because opinion that useful though many purposes suitable either drinking washing ones hands incorrect represent attitude liberalism toward state saying that wishes restrict latters sphere possible activity that abhors principle activity part state relation economic life Such interpretation altogether question stand that liberalism takes regard problem function state necessary consequence advocacy private ownership means production favor latter cannot course also favor communal ownership means production placing them disposition government rather than individual owners Thus advocacy private ownership means production already implies very severe functions assigned state socialists sometimes wont reproach liberalism with lack consistency they maintain illogical restrict activity state economic sphere exclusively protection property difficult state remain completely neutral intervention limited protecting rights property owners This reproach would justified only opposition liberalism governmental activity economic sphere going beyond protection property stemmed from aversion principle against activity part state that means case reason liberalism opposes further extension sphere governmental activity precisely that this would effect abolish private ownership means production private property liberal sees principle most suitable organization mans life society Democracy Liberalism therefore from disputing necessity machinery state system government grave associate with idea anarchism liberal state absolute necessity since most important tasks incumbent upon protection only private property also peace absence latter full benefits private property cannot reaped These considerations alone suffice determine conditions that state must fulfill order correspond liberal ideal must only able protect private property must also constituted that smooth peaceful course development never interrupted civil wars revolutions insurrections Many people still haunted idea which dates back preliberal that certain nobility dignity attaches exercise governmental functions very recently public officials Germany enjoyed indeed still enjoy even today prestige that made most highly respected career that civil servant social esteem which young assessor lieutenant held exceeds that businessman attorney grown honest labor Writers scholars artists whose fame glory have spread beyond Germany enjoy their

special distinction dignity attaching exercise functions government what constitutes basis theory state According this doctrine shameful anyone allow himself ruled others ideal constitution which whole people rules governs This course never been never never will possible even under conditions prevailing small state once thought that this ideal been realized Greek citystates antiquity small

possible distinguish five different conceivable systems organizing cooperation individuals society based division labor system private ownership means production which developed form call capitalism system private ownership means production with periodic confiscation wealth subsequent redistribution system syndicalism system public ownership means production which known socialism communism finally system history private ownership means production coincides with history development mankind from animallike condition highest reaches modern civilization opponents private property have gone great pains demonstrate that primeval beginnings human society institution private property still exist complete form because part land under cultivation subject periodic redistribution From this observation which shows that private property only historical category they have tried draw conclusion that could once again quite safely dispensed with logical fallacy involved this reasoning flagrant require further discussion That there social cooperation remote antiquity even absence completely realized system private property cannot provide slightest proof that could manage without private property just well higher stages civilization history could prove anything regard this question could only that nowhere time there ever been people which raised itself without private property above condition most oppressive penury savagery scarcely from animal existence earlier opponents system private ownership means production attack institution private property such only inequality income distribution They recommended abolition inequality income wealth means system periodical redistribution total quantity commodities least land which that time virtually only factor production taken into consideration backward countries where primitive agricultural production prevails this idea equal distribution property still holds sway today People accustomed call agrarian socialism though appellation apposite since this system nothing with socialism Bolshevist revolution Russia which begun socialist establish socialism agricultureie communal ownership landbut instead agrarian socialism large areas rest Eastern Europe division landed estates among small farmers under name agrarian reform ideal espoused influential political parties unnecessary enter further into discussion this system That must result reduction output human labor will scarcely disputed Only where land still cultivated most primitive fail recognize decrease productivity which follows upon division distribution That utterly senseless break dairy farm equipped with devices modern technology will conceded everyone transference this principle division distribution industry commercial enterprises altogether unthinkable railroad rolling mill machine factory cannot divided could undertake carry periodical redistribution property only first completely broke economy based division labor unhampered market returned economy selfsufficient farmsteads existing side side without engaging exchange idea syndicalism represents attempt adapt ideal equal distribution property circumstances modern largescale industry Syndicalism seeks invest ownership means production neither individuals society workers employed each industry branch production Since proportion which material personal factors production combined different different branches production equality distribution property cannot attained this From very outset worker will receive greater portion property some branches industry than others only consider difficulties that must arise from necessity continually present economy shifting capital labor from branch production another Will possible withdraw capital from branch industry order thereby more generously equip another Will possible remove workers from branch production order transfer them another where quota capital worker smaller impossibility such transfers renders syndicalist commonwealth utterly absurd impracticable form social organization assume that over above individual groups there exists central power that entitled carry such transfers longer dealing with syndicalism with socialism reality syndicalism social ideal absurd that only muddleheads have sufficiently thought problem through have ventured advocate principle Socialism communism that organization society which propertythe power deploying means productionis vested society state social apparatus compulsion coercion society judged socialist consequence whether social dividend distributed equally according some other principle Neither decisive significance whether socialism brought about formal transfer ownership means production state social apparatus compulsion coercion whether private owners retain their property name socialization consists fact that these owners entitled employ means production left their hands only according instructions issued state government decides what produced whom sold what price then private property still exists name only reality property already socialized mainspring economic activity longer profitseeking part entrepreneurs capitalists necessity fulfilling imposed duty obeying commands Finally still have speak According widespread opinion there midway between socialism capitalism third possibility social organization system private property regulated controlled guided isolated authoritarian decrees acts intervention system periodical redistribution property system syndicalism will discussed what follows These systems generally issue taken seriously advocates either have concern ourselves only with socialism capitalism Private Property Critics Mans life state unalloyed happiness earth paradise Although this fault social institutions people wont hold them responsible foundation every civilization including private ownership means production Whoever wishes criticize modern civilization therefore begins with private property blamed everything that does please critic especially those evils that have their origin fact that private property been hampered restrained various respects that full social potentialities cannot realized usual procedure adopted critic imagine wonderful everything would only dreams eliminates every will opposed raising himself someone whose will coincides exactly with position absolute master world Everyone preaches right stronger considers himself stronger espouses institution slavery never stops reflect that himself could slave demands restrictions liberty conscience demands regard others himself advocates oligarchic form government always includes himself oligarchy goes into ecstasies thought enlightened despotism dictatorship immodest enough allot himself daydreams role enlightened despot dictator least expect that himself will become despot over despot dictator over dictator Just desires himself position weaker oppressed overpowered negatively privileged subject without rights under socialism desires himself otherwise than role general director mentor general director dream wish fantasies socialism there other life that would worth living Anticapitalist literature created fixed pattern these fantasies daydreamer customary opposition between profitability productivity What takes place capitalist social order contrasted thought with desires criticwould accomplished ideal socialist society Everything that deviates from this ideal image characterized unproductive That greatest profitability private individuals greatest productivity community always coincide long considered most serious reproach against capitalist system Only recent years knowledge gained ground that majority these cases socialist community could proceed differently from individuals capitalist community even where alleged opposition actually does exist cannot simply assumed that socialist society would necessarily what right that capitalist social order always condemned does anything else concept productivity altogether subjective never provide startingpoint objective criticism worth while therefore concern ourselves with musings dream vision everyone willing obedient ready execute commands immediately punctiliously quite another question things must appear real merely visionary socialist society assumption that equal distribution total annual output capitalist economy among members society would suffice assure everyone sufficient livelihood simple statistical calculations show altogether false Thus socialist society could scarcely achieve perceptible increase standard living masses this holds prospect wellbeing even riches only assumption that labor socialist society will more productive than under capitalism that socialist system will able dispense with number superfluousand consequently connection with this second point thinks example abolition those expenses originating costs marketing merchandise competition advertising clear that there room socialist community such expenditures must forget that socialist apparatus distribution will involve inconsiderable costs perhaps even greater than those capitalist economy this decisive element judgment significance these expenses socialist assumes without question matter course that socialist system productivity labor will least same capitalist society seeks prove that will even greater first assumption means selfevident advocates socialism seem think quantity things produced capitalist society independent manner which production carried What decisive significance that every single stage each branch production special interest persons engaged bound most intimately with productivity particular share labor being performed Every worker must exert himself utmost since wages determined output labor every entrepreneur must strive produce more cheaplyie with less expenditure capital laborthan competitors Only because these incentives capitalist economy been able produce wealth that command take exception alleged excessive costs capitalist marketing apparatus take myopic view things indeed Whoever reproaches capitalism with squandering resources because there many competing haberdashers even more tobacconists found bustling business streets fails that this sales organization only result apparatus production that warrants greatest productivity labor advances production have been achieved only because nature this apparatus continually make advances Only because entrepreneurs constant competition mercilessly weeded they produce most profitable manner methods production perpetually being improved refined Were this incentive disappear there would further progress production effort economize application traditional methods Consequently completely absurd pose question much could saved costs advertising were abolished must rather much could produced competition among producers were abolished answer this question cannot doubt consume only they labor then only much their labor produced characteristic feature capitalist system that provides each member society with this incentive carry work with greatest efficiency thus achieves highest output socialist society this direct connection between labor individual goods services might thereby enjoy would lacking incentive work would consist possibility enjoying fruit ones labor command authorities work ones feeling duty precise demonstration that this organization labor unfeasible will offered later chapter What always criticized capitalist system fact that owners means production occupy preferential position They live without working views social order from standpoint must this serious shortcoming capitalism should better than another whoever considers things from standpoint individual persons from that whole social order will find that owners property preserve their agreeable position solely condition that they perform service indispensable society capitalist keep favored position only shifting means production application most important society does thisif invests wealth unwiselyhe will suffer losses does correct mistake time will soon ruthlessly ousted from preferential position will cease capitalist others better qualified will take place capitalist society deployment means production always hands those best fitted whether they want they must constantly take care employ means production such that they yield greatest output Private Property Government those positions political power governments kings republican authorities have always looked askance private property There inherent tendency governmental power recognize restraints operation extend sphere dominion much possible control everything leave room anything happen accord without interference goal which every ruler secretly strives only private property stand Private property creates individual sphere which free state sets limits operation authoritarian will allows other forces arise side side with opposition political power thus becomes basis those activities that free from violent interference part state soil which seeds freedom nurtured which autonomy individual ultimately intellectual material progress rooted this sense even been called fundamental prerequisite development individual only with many reservations that latter formulation considered acceptable because customary opposition between individual collectivity between collective ideas aims even between universalistic science empty shibboleth Thus there never been political power that voluntarily desisted from impeding free development operation institution private ownership means production Governments tolerate private property when they compelled they acknowledge voluntarily recognition necessity Even liberal politicians gaining power have usually relegated their liberal principles more less background tendency impose oppressive restraints private property abuse political power refuse respect recognize free sphere outside beyond dominion state deeply ingrained mentality those control governmental apparatus compulsion coercion them ever able resist voluntarily liberal government contradictio must forced into adopting liberalism power unanimous opinion people that they could voluntarily become liberal expected easy understand what would constrain rulers recognize property rights their subjects society composed exclusively farmers whom were equally rich such social order every attempt abridge right property would immediately meet with resistance united front subjects against government thus bring about latters fall situation essentially different however society which there only agricultural also industrial production especially where there business enterprises involving largescale investments industry mining trade such society quite possible those control government take action against private property fact politically there nothing more advantageous government than attack property rights always easy matter incite masses against owners land capital From time immemorial therefore been idea absolute monarchs despots tyrants ally themselves with people against propertied classes Second Empire Louis Napoleon only regime founded principle Caesarism Prussian authoritarian state Hohenzollerns also took idea introduced Lassalle into German politics during Prussian constitutional struggle winning masses workers battle against liberal bourgeoisie means policy etatism This basic principle social monarchy highly extolled Schmoller school spite persecutions however institution private property survived Neither animosity governments hostile campaign waged against writers moralists churches religions resentment massesitself deeply rooted instinctive envyhas availed abolish Every attempt replace with some other method organizing production distribution always itself promptly proved unfeasible point absurdity People have recognize that institution private property indispensable revert whether they liked that they have still refused admit that reason this return institution free private ownership means production found fact that economic system serving needs purposes mans life society principle impracticable except this foundation People have been unable make their minds themselves ideology which they have become attached namely belief that private property evil that cannot least time being dispensed with long have sufficiently evolved ethically While their intentions course inherent tendency every organized center powerhave reconciled themselves existence private property they have still continued adhere firmlynot only outwardly also their thinkingto ideology hostile property rights Indeed they consider opposition private property correct principle deviation from their part solely their weakness consideration interests powerful groups Socialism People wont consider socialism impracticable because they think that lack moral qualities demanded socialist society feared that under socialism most will exhibit same zeal performance duties tasks assigned them that they bring their daily work social order based private ownership means production capitalist society every individual knows that fruit labor enjoy that income increases decreases according output labor greater smaller socialist society every individual will think that less depends efficiency labor since fixed portion total output case amount latter cannot appreciably diminished loss resulting from laziness feared such conviction should become general productivity labor socialist community would drop considerably objection thus raised against socialism completely sound does heart matter Were possible socialist community ascertain output labor every individual comrade with same precision with which this accomplished each worker means economic calculation capitalist system practicability socialism would dependent good will every individual Society would position least within certain limits determine share total output allotted each worker basis extent contribution production What renders socialism impracticable precisely fact that calculation this kind impossible socialist society capitalist system calculation profitability constitutes guide that indicates individual whether enterprise operating ought under given circumstances operation whether being most efficient possible least cost factors production undertaking proves unprofitable this means that materials halffinished goods labor that needed employed other enterprises that from standpoint consumers more urgent more important same more economical manner with smaller expenditure capital labor When instance hand weaving came unprofitable this signified that capital labor employed weaving machine yield greater output that consequently uneconomical adhere method production which same input capital labor yields smaller output enterprise being planned calculate advance whether made profitable what example intention constructing railroad line estimating traffic expected ability freight rates calculate whether pays invest capital labor such undertaking result this calculation shows that projected railroad promises profit this tantamount saying that there other more urgent employment capital labor that construction railroad would require world rich enough able afford such expenditure only when question arises whether given undertaking begun that calculation value profitability decisive controls every single step that entrepreneur takes conduct business Capitalist economic calculation which alone makes rational production possible based monetary calculation Only because prices goods services market expressed terms money possible them spite their heterogeneity enter into calculation involving homogeneous units measurement socialist society where means production owned community where consequently there market exchange productive goods services there also money prices goods services higher order Such social system would thus necessity lacking means rational management business enterprises economic calculation economic calculation cannot take place absence common denominator which heterogeneous goods services reduced consider quite simple case construction railroad from several routes conceivable suppose that mountain stands between railroad made over mountain around mountain tunnel through mountain capitalist society very easy matter compute which line will prove most profitable ascertains cost involved constructing each three lines differences operating costs necessarily incurred anticipated traffic each From these quantities difficult determine which stretch road will most profitable socialist society could make such calculations would have possible reducing uniform standard measurement heterogeneous quantities qualities goods services that here come into consideration face ordinary everyday problems which management economy presents socialist society would stand helpless would have possible keeping accounts prosperity that made possible many more people inhabit earth today than precapitalist solely capitalist method lengthy chains production which necessarily requires monetary calculation This impossible under socialism vain have socialist writers labored demonstrate could still manage even without monetary price calculation their efforts this respect have with failure leadership socialist society would thus confronted problem that could possibly solve would able decide which innumerable possible modes procedure most rational resulting chaos economy would culminate quickly irresistibly universal impoverishment retrogression primitive conditions under which ancestors once lived socialist ideal carried logical conclusion would eventuate social order which means production were owned people whole Production would completely hands government center power society alone would determine what produced what goods ready consumption were distributed makes little difference whether imagine this socialist state future democratically constituted otherwise Even democratic socialist state would necessarily constitute tightly organized bureaucracy which everyone apart from highest officials though might very well capacity voter have participated some fashion framing directives issued central authority would subservient position administrator bound carry them obediently socialist state this kind comparable state enterprises matter vast their scale that have seen developing last decades Europe especially Germany Russia latter flourish side side with private ownership means production They engage commercial transactions with enterprises that capitalists manage they receive various stimuli from these enterprises that invigorate their operation State railroads instance provided their suppliers manufacturers locomotives coaches signal installations other equipment with apparatus that proved successful elsewhere operation privately owned railroads Thence they receive incentive institute innovations order keep with progress technology methods business management that taking place around them matter common knowledge that national municipal enterprises have hole failed that they expensive inefficient that they have subsidized funds just maintain themselves operation course where public enterprise occupies monopolistic positionas instance generally case with municipal transportation facilities electric light power plantsthe consequences inefficiency need always express themselves visible financial failure Under certain circumstances possible conceal making opportunity open monopolist raising price products services high enough render these enterprises spite their uneconomic management still profitable lower productivity socialist method production merely manifests itself differently here easily recognized otherwise essentially however case remains same none these experiments socialist management enterprises afford basis judging what would mean socialist ideal communal ownership means production were realized socialist society future which will leave room whatsoever free activity private enterprises operating side side with those owned controlled state central planning board will lack entirely gauge provided whole economy market market prices market where goods services come traded exchange ratios expressed money prices determined everything bought sold social order based private property thus becomes possible resort monetary calculation checking results economic activities social productivity every economic transaction tested methods bookkeeping cost accounting remains shown that public enterprises unable make cost accounting same private enterprises Nevertheless monetary calculation does give even governmental communal enterprises some basis judging success failure their management completely socialist economic system this would quite impossible absence private ownership means production there could exchange capital goods market consequently neither money prices monetary calculation general management purely socialist society wall therefore have means reducing common denominator costs production heterogeneous commodities that plans produce this achieved setting expenditures kind against savings kind cannot calculate possible reduce common medium expression hours labor various grades iron coal building materials every kind machines other things needed operation management different enterprises Calculation possible only when able reduce monetary terms goods under consideration course monetary calculation imperfections deficiencies have nothing better place suffices practical purposes life long monetary system sound were renounce monetary calculation every economic computation would become absolutely impossible This decisive objection that economics raises against possibility socialist society must forgo intellectual division labor that consists cooperation entrepreneurs landowners workers producers consumers formation market prices without rationality possibility economic calculation unthinkable socialist ideal beginning lose more more adherents penetrating economic sociological investigations problems socialism that have shown impracticable have remained without effect failures which socialist experiments everywhere have ended have disconcerted even most enthusiastic supporters Gradually people once more beginning realize that society cannot without private property hostile criticism which system private ownership means production been subjected decades left behind such strong prejudice against capitalist system that spite their knowledge inadequacy socialism people cannot make their minds admit openly that they must return liberal views question property sure conceded that socialism communal ownership means production altogether least present impracticable other hand asserted that unhampered private ownership means production also evil Thus people want create third form society standing midway between private ownership means production hand communal ownership means production other Private property will permitted exist ways which means production employed entrepreneurs capitalists landowners will regulated guided controlled authoritarian decrees prohibitions this forms conceptual image regulated market capitalism circumscribed authoritarian rules private property shorn allegedly harmful concomitant features intervention authorities best acquire insight into meaning nature this system considering examples consequences government interference crucial acts intervention with which have deal fixing prices goods services height different from what unhampered market would have determined case prices formed unhampered market which would have been formed absence interference part authorities costs production covered proceeds lower price decreed government proceeds will fall short costs Merchants manufacturers will therefore unless storage goods involved would cause them deteriorate rapidly value withhold their merchandise from market hope more favorable times perhaps expectation that government order will soon rescinded authorities want goods concerned disappear altogether from market result their interference they cannot limit themselves fixing price they must same time also decree that stocks hand sold prescribed price even this does suffice price determined unhampered market supply demand would have coincided because price fixed lower government decree demand increased while supply remained unchanged stocks hand sufficient satisfy fully prepared prescribed price part demand will remain unsatisfied mechanism market which otherwise tends equalize supply demand means price fluctuations longer operates people would have been prepared price prescribed authorities must leave market with empty hands Those were line earlier were position exploit some personal connection with sellers have already acquired whole stock others have unprovided government wishes avoid this consequence intervention which runs counter intentions must rationing price control compulsory sale governmental regulation must determine much commodity supplied each individual applicant prescribed price once supplies already hand moment governments intervention exhausted incomparably more difficult problem arises Since production longer profitable goods sold price fixed government will reduced entirely suspended government wishes have production continue must compel manufacturers produce this must also prices materials halffinished goods wages labor decrees this effect however cannot limited only branches production that authorities wish regulate because they deem their products especially important They must encompass branches production They must regulate price commodities wages short they must extend their control over conduct entrepreneurs capitalists landowners workers some branches production left free capital labor will flow into these government will fail attain goal that wished achieve first intervention object authorities that there should abundance production precisely that branch industry which because importance they attach products they have especially singled regulation runs altogether counter their design that precisely consequence their intervention this branch production should neglected therefore clearly evident that attempt part government interfere with operation economic system based private ownership means production fails goal that authors wished achieve means from point view authors only futile downright contrary purpose because enormously augments very evil that supposed combat Before price controls were decreed commodity opinion government expensive disappears from market altogether This however result aimed government which wanted make commodity accessible consumer cheaper price contrary from viewpoint absence commodity impossibility securing must appear greater evil this sense intervention authorities that futile contrary purpose that intended serve system economic policy that attempts operate means such acts intervention that impracticable unthinkable that contradicts economic logic Government will this right again desisting from interference rescinding price controls then must follow first step with others prohibition against asking price higher than prescribed must only measures compel sale stocks hand under system enforced rationing price ceilings goods higher order wage controls ultimately compulsory labor entrepreneurs workers these regulations cannot limited branches production must encompass them There simply other choice than this either abstain from interference free play market delegate entire management production distribution government Either capitalism socialism there exists middle mechanism series events just described well known have witnessed attempts governments time during periods inflation prices fiat Everyone knows nowadays that government price controls other result than disappearance from market goods concerned Wherever government resorts fixing prices result always same When instance government fixes ceiling residential rents housing shortage immediately ensues Austria Social Democratic Party virtually abolished residential rent consequence that city Vienna example spite fact that population declined considerably since beginning World that several thousand houses have been constructed municipality meantime many thousands persons unable find accommodations take still another example fixing minimum wage rates When relationship between employer employee left undisturbed legislative enactments violent measures part trade unions wages paid employer every type labor exactly high increment value that adds materials production Wages cannot rise higher than this because they employer could longer make profit hence would compelled discontinue line production that neither wages fall lower because then workers would turn other branches industry where they would better rewarded that employer would forced discontinue production because labor shortage There therefore economy always wage rate which workers find employment every entrepreneur wishes undertake some enterprise still profitable that wage finds workers This wage rate customarily called economists static natural wage increases other things being equal number workers diminishes decreases other things being equal available quantity capital which employment production sought suffers diminution However must same time observe that quite precise speak simply wages labor Labor services vary greatly quality quantity calculated unit time wages labor economy never varied from stationary state then labor market unhampered interference part government coercion part labor unions there would unemployed stationary state society merely imaginary construction economic theory intellectual expedient indispensable thinking that enables contrast form clear conception processes actually taking place economy which surrounds which live hasten addis never rest There never standstill economy perpetual changes movement innovation continual emergence unprecedented There accordingly always branches production that being shut down curtailed because demand their products fallen other branches production that being expanded even embarked upon first time think only last decades once enumerate great number industries that have sprung automobile industry airplane industry motion picture industry rayon industry canned goods industry radio broadcasting industry These branches industry today employ millions workers only some whom have been drawn from increase population Some came from branches production that were shut down even more from those that result technological improvements able manage with fewer workers Occasionally changes that occur relations among individual branches production take place slowly that worker obliged shift type only young people just beginning earn their livelihood will enter greater proportion expanding industries Generally however capitalist system with rapid strides improving human welfare progress takes place swiftly spare individuals necessity adapting themselves When hundred years more young learned craft could count practicing whole life long learned without fear being injured conservatism Things different today worker must adjust himself changing conditions must what learned begin learning anew must leave occupations which longer require same number workers previously enter which just come into being which needs more workers than before even remains must learn techniques when circumstances demand this affects worker form changes wage rates particular branch business employs relatively many workers discharges some those discharged will easily find work same branch business pressure labor market exercised discharged workers depresses wages this branch production This turn induces worker look employment those branches production that wish attract workers therefore prepared higher wages From this becomes quite clear what must done order satisfy workers desire employment high wages Wages general cannot pushed above height that they would normally occupy market unhampered either government interference other institutional pressures without creating certain side effects that cannot desirable worker Wages driven individual industry individual country transfer workers from other industries their immigration from other countries prohibited Such wage increases effected expense workers whose entrance barred Their wages lower than they would have been their freedom movement been hindered rise wages group thus achieved expense others This policy obstructing free movement labor benefit only workers countries industries suffering from relative labor shortage industry country where this case there only thing that raise wages rise general productivity labor whether virtue increase capital available through improvement technological processes production however government fixes minimum wages above height static natural wage then employers will find that they longer position carry successfully number enterprises that were still profitable when wages stood lower point They will consequently curtail production discharge workers effect artificial rise wages imposed upon market from outside therefore spread unemployment course attempt being made today minimum wage rates large scale position power that trade unions occupy enabled them even absence positive legislation that effect fact that workers form unions purpose bargaining with employers does itself necessarily provoke disturbances operation market Even fact that they successfully arrogate themselves right break without notice contracts duly entered into them down their tools would itself result further disturbance labor market What does create situation labor market element coercion involved strikes compulsory union membership that prevails today most industrial countries Europe Since unionized workers deny access employment those members their union resort open violence during strikes prevent other workers from taking place those strike wage demands that unions present employers have precisely same force government decrees fixing minimum wage rates employer must does wish shut down whole enterprise yield demands union must wages such that volume production restricted because what costs more produce cannot find large market what costs less Thus higher wages exacted trade unions become cause unemployment unemployment originating from this source differs entirely extent duration from that which arises from changes constantly taking place kind quality labor demanded market unemployment cause only fact that there constant progress industrial development could neither assume great proportions take character lasting institution workers longer employed branch production soon find accommodation others which expanding just coming into being When workers enjoy freedom movement shift from industry another impeded legal other obstacles similar kind adjustment conditions takes place without much difficulty rather quickly rest setting labor exchanges would contribute much toward reducing still further extent this type unemployment unemployment produced interference coercive agencies operation labor market transitory phenomenon continually appearing disappearing incurable long cause that called into existence continues operate long violence trade unions prevents wages from being reduced pressure jobless seeking employment level that they would have reached absence interference part government unions namely rate which those eager work ultimately find unemployed granted support government unions only serves enlarge evil what involved case unemployment springing from dynamic changes economy then unemployment benefits only result postponing adjustment workers conditions jobless worker relief does consider necessary look about occupation longer finds position least allows more time elapse before decides shift occupation locality before reduces wage rate demands that which could find work unemployment benefits that long they offered unemployment cannot disappear however unemployment produced artificial raising height wage rates consequence direct intervention government toleration coercive practices part trade unions then only question bear costs involved employers workers state government community never they load them either onto employer onto worker partially onto each burden falls workers then they deprived entirely partially fruits artificial wage increase they have received they even made bear more these costs than artificial wage increase yielded them employer saddled with burden unemployment benefits some extent having proportionate total amount wages paid this case unemployment insurance raising costs labor same effect further increase wages above static level profitability employment labor reduced number workers still profitably engaged concomitantly decreased Thus unemployment spreads even further ever widening spiral employers also drawn costs unemployment benefits means their profits capital without regard number workers employed this only tends spread unemployment even further when capital consumed when formation capital least slowed down conditions employment labor become ceteris paribus less favorable obviously futile attempt eliminate unemployment embarking upon program public works that would otherwise have been undertaken necessary resources such projects must withdrawn taxes loans from application they would otherwise have found Unemployment industry this mitigated only extent that increased another From whichever side consider becomes evident that this system leads result that originators advocates intend that even from their standpoint must appear senseless selfdefeating absurd policy Capitalism Only Possible System Social Organization Every examination different conceivable possibilities organizing society basis division labor must always come same result there only choice between communal ownership private ownership means production intermediate forms social organization unavailing practice must prove selfdefeating further realizes that socialism unworkable then cannot avoid acknowledging that capitalism only feasible system social organization based division labor This result theoretical investigation will come surprise historian philosopher history capitalism succeeded maintaining itself spite enmity always encountered from both governments masses been obliged make other forms social cooperation that have enjoyed much greater extent sympathies theoreticians practical affairs this attributed only fact that other system social organization feasible there further need explain impossible return forms social economic organization characteristic Middle Ages Over whole area inhabited modern nations Europe medieval economic system able support only fraction number people dwell that region placed much less material goods disposal each individual provision needs than capitalist form production supplies with today return Middle Ages question prepared reduce population tenth twentieth part present number even further oblige every individual satisfied with modicum small beyond imagination modern writers represent return Middle Ages they Middle Ages only social ideal worth striving reproach capitalist above materialistic attitude mentality they themselves much more deeply committed materialistic views than they believe nothing crassest materialism think many these writers that after reverting forms political economic organization characteristic Middle Ages society could still retain technological improvements production created capitalism thus preserve high degree productivity human labor that attained capitalist productivity capitalist mode production outcome capitalist mentality capitalist approach satisfaction mans wants result modern technology only development technology must necessity follow from capitalist mentality There scarcely anything absurd fundamental principle Marxs materialist interpretation history hand mill made feudal society steam mill capitalist society precisely capitalist society that needed create necessary conditions original

foundations which they based were destroyed Economic activity longer carried rationally once prevailing mentality reverted traditionalism faith authority entrepreneur catalytic agent were capitalist economy concomitantly also modern technology inconceivable environment which everyone intent solely contemplative life characterizes unfeasible every system other than that based private ownership means production follows necessarily that private property must maintained basis social cooperation association that every attempt abolish must vigorously combated this reason that liberalism defends institution private property against every attempt destroy When therefore people call liberals apologists private property they completely justified Greek word from which apologist derived means same defender course would better avoid using foreign word content express oneself plain English many people expressions apology apologist convey connotation that what being defended unjust Much more important however than rejection pejorative suggestion that involved these expressions observation that institution private property requires defense justification support explanation continued existence society depends upon private property since have need society they must hold fast institution private property avoid injuring their interests well interests everyone else society continue exist only foundation private property Whoever champions latter champions same token preservation social bond that unites mankind preservation culture civilization apologist defender society culture civilization because desires them ends must also desire defend means that leads them namely private property advocate private ownership means production means maintain that capitalist social system based private property perfect There such thing earthly perfection Even capitalist system something other many things even everything exactly liking this that individual only possible social system undertake modify another features long doing does affect essence foundation whole social order private property large must reconcile ourselves this system because there simply cannot other Nature much exist that like cannot change essential character natural events example someone thinksand there some have maintained muchthat which ingests food digests incorporates into body disgusting cannot argue point with must There only this starvation There third same true property eitheroreither private ownership means production hunger misery everyone opponents liberalism wont call economic doctrine optimistic They intend this epithet either reproach derisive liberal thinking calling liberal doctrine optimistic means that liberalism considers capitalist world best worlds then this nothing pure nonsense ideology based like that liberalism entirely scientific grounds such questions whether capitalist system good whether better conceivable whether ought rejected certain philosophic metaphysical grounds entirely irrelevant Liberalism derived from pure sciences economics sociology which make value judgments within their spheres nothing about what ought about what good what contrary only ascertain what comes When these sciences show that conceivable alternative ways organizing society only system based private ownership means production capable being realized because other conceivable systems social organization unworkable there absolutely nothing this that justify designation optimistic That capitalism practicable workable conclusion that nothing with optimism sure opponents liberalism opinion that this society very this assertion contains value judgment naturally open discussion that intends beyond highly subjective therefore unscientific opinions however founded incorrect understanding what takes place within capitalist system economics sociology rectify This optimism Entirely aside from everything else even discovery great many deficiencies capitalist system would have slightest significance problems social policy long been shown that different social system would better that would capable being realized this been done Science succeeded showing that every system social organization that could conceived substitute capitalist system unavailing that could bring about results aimed proponents little justified speaking this connection optimism pessimism much liberalism optimistic aims surrounding with unfavorable aura bringing emotional considerations best shown fact that with much justice call those people optimists convinced that construction socialist commonwealth would practicable Most writers concern themselves with economic questions never miss opportunity heap senseless childish abuse capitalist system praise enthusiastic terms either socialism even agrarian socialism syndicalism excellent institutions other hand there have been writers even much milder terms have sung praises capitalist system wishes call these writers optimists does then would thousand times more justified calling antiliberal writers hyperoptimists socialism agrarian socialism syndicalism fact that this does happen that instead only liberal writers like Bastiat called optimists shows clearly that these cases what dealing with attempt truly scientific classification nothing more than partisan caricature What liberalism maintains repeat means that capitalism good when considered from some particular point view What says simply that attainment ends that have mind only capitalist system suitable that every attempt realize socialist agrarian socialist syndicalist society must necessarily prove unsuccessful Neurotics could bear this truth have called economics dismal science economics sociology more dismal because they show world really than other sciences aremechanics instance because teaches perpetual motion biology because teaches mortality living things Cartels Monopolies Liberalism opponents liberalism assert that necessary preconditions adoption liberal program longer exist contemporary world Liberalism still practicable when many concerns medium size were engaged keen competition each industry Nowadays since trusts cartels other monopolistic enterprises complete control market liberalism good done case politics that destroyed tendency inherent inexorable evolution system free enterprise division labor gives specialized function each productive unit economy This process never stops long economic development continues long passed stage which same factory produced types machines Today machine factory that does limit itself exclusively production certain types machinery longer able meet competition With progress specialization area served individual supplier must continue widen market supplied textile mill that produces only kinds fabrics must larger than that served weaver weaves every kind cloth Undoubtedly this progressive specialization production tends toward development every field enterprises that have whole world their market this development opposed protectionist other anticapitalist measures result will that every branch production there will relatively small number concerns even only single concern intent producing with highest degree specialization supplying whole world Today course very from this state affairs since policy governments aims snipping from unity world economy small areas which under protection tariffs other measures designed achieve same result enterprises that would longer able meet competition free world market artificially preserved even first called into being Apart from considerations commercial policy measures this kind which directed against concentration business defended ground that they alone have prevented consumers from being exploited monopolistic combinations producers order assess validity this argument shall assume that division labor throughout whole world already advanced that production every article offered sale concentrated single concern that consumer capacity buyer always confronted with only single seller Under such conditions according illconsidered economic doctrine producers would position keep prices pegged high they wished realize exorbitant profits thereby worsen considerably standard living consumers difficult that this idea completely mistaken Monopoly prices they made possible certain acts intervention part government lastingly exacted only basis control over mineral other natural resources isolated monopoly manufacturing that yielded greater profits than those yielded elsewhere would stimulate formation rival firms whose competition would break monopoly restore prices profits general rate Monopolies manufacturing industries cannot however become general since every given level wealth economy total quantity capital invested available labor employed production consequently also amount social productis given magnitude particular branch production several amount capital labor employed could reduced order increase price unit aggregate profit monopolist monopolists curtailing production capital labor thereby freed would then flow into another industry however industries attempt curtail production order realize higher prices they forthwith free labor capital which because they offered lower rates will provide strong stimulus formation enterprises that must again destroy monopolistic position others idea universal cartel monopoly manufacturing industry therefore completely untenable Genuine monopolies established only control land mineral resources notion that arable land earth could consolidated into single world monopoly needs further discussion only monopolies that shall consider here those originating control useful minerals Monopolies this kind fact already exist case minerals minor importance rate conceivable that attempts monopolize other minerals well some prove successful This would mean that owners such mines quarries would derive increased ground rent from them that consumers would restrict consumption look substitutes materials that become more expensive world petroleum monopoly would lead increased demand hydroelectric power coal From standpoint world economy specie aeternitatis this would mean that would have more sparing than otherwise would have been those costly materials that only exhaust cannot replace thus leave more them future generations than would have been case economy free monopolies bugbear monopoly which always conjured when speaks unhampered development economy need cause disquiet world monopolies that really feasible could concern only items primary production Whether their effect favorable unfavorable cannot easily decided eyes those treating economic problems unable free themselves from feelings envy these monopolies appear pernicious from very fact that they yield their owners increased profits Whoever approaches question without prepossessions will find that such monopolies lead more sparing those mineral resources that mans disposal only rather limited quantity really envies monopolist profit without danger without having expect harmful economic consequences have pass into public coffers taxing income from mines these world monopolies national international monopolies which practical importance today precisely because they originate natural evolutionary tendency part economic system when left itself product antiliberal economic policies Attempts secure monopolistic position regard certain articles almost cases feasible only because tariffs have divided world market into small national markets Besides these only other cartels consequence those which owners certain natural resources able form because high cost transportation protects them against competition producers from other areas narrow compass their locality fundamental error judging consequences trusts cartels enterprises supplying market with article alone speak control market price dictation monopolist monopolist does exercise control position dictate prices could speak control market price dictation only article question were strictest most literal sense word necessary existence absolutely irreplaceable substitute This evidently true commodity There economic good whose possession indispensable existence those prepared purchase market What distinguishes formation monopoly price from formation competitive price fact that under certain very special conditions possible monopolist reap greater profit from sale smaller quantity higher price which call monopoly price than selling price that market would determine more sellers were competition competitive price special condition required emergence monopoly price that reaction consumers price increase does involve falling demand sharp preclude greater total profit from fewer sales higher prices actually possible achieve monopolistic position market realize monopoly prices then profits higher than average will yielded branch industry concerned that spite these higher profits enterprises same kind undertaken because fear that after reducing monopoly price competitive price they will prove profitable must nevertheless take into account possibility that related industries which position enter into production cartelized article relatively small cost appear competitors case industries producing substitute commodities will immediately hand avail themselves favorable circumstances expanding their production these factors make rare monopoly arise manufacturing industry that based monopolistic control particular materials Where such monopolies occur they always made possible only certain legislative measures such patents similar privileges tariff regulations laws licensing system decades people used speak transportation monopoly what extent this monopoly based licensing system remains uncertain Today people generally bother much about automobile airplane have become dangerous competitors railroads even before appearance these competitors possibility using waterways already definite limit rates that railroads could venture charge their services several lines only gross exaggeration facts speak commonly does today formation monopolies having eliminated essential prerequisite realization liberal ideal capitalist society Twist turn monopoly problem always comes back fact that monopoly prices possible only where there control over natural resources particular kind where legislative enactments their administration create necessary conditions formation monopolies unhampered development economy with exception mining related branches production there tendency toward exclusion competition objection commonly raised against liberalism that conditions competition they existed time when classical economics liberal ideas were first developed longer prevail justified Only liberal demands free trade within between nations need realized order reestablish these conditions There another sense which commonly said that necessary conditions realization liberal ideal society longer obtain today businesses made necessary progress division labor personnel employed must increase more more These enterprises must therefore their conduct business become ever more like government bureaucracy that liberals particular have made target their criticism From they become more cumbersome less open innovations selection personnel executive positions longer made basis demonstrated proficiency accordance with purely formal criteria such educational background seniority often just result personal favoritism Thus distinctive feature private opposed public enterprise finally disappears still justifiable classical liberalism oppose government ownership ground that paralyzes free initiative kills labor longer today when private enterprises carried less pedantically than those that publicly owned operated order able assess validity these objections must first clear what really understood bureaucracy bureaucratic conduct business just these distinguished from commercial enterprise commercial conduct business opposition between commercial bureaucratic mentality counterpart

total result long enterprises look only profit they proof against evils bureaucratism privately owned enterprises that going about everywhere today purely result which forces them take into account factors that they were free determine their policies themselves would from playing role whatsoever conduct their business When concern must heed political prejudices sensibilities kinds order avoid

with public opinion with legislative judicial administrative organs government which influences make policy hire Catholics Jews atheists Darwinists Negroes Irishmen Germans Italians newly arrived immigrants state every business under necessity accommodating itself wishes authorities order avoid burdensome penalties result that these other considerations foreign profitseeking principle management come play ever increasing role conduct business while part played precise calculation cost accounting concomitantly dwindles significance private enterprise begins increasingly adopt mode management public enterprises with their elaborate apparatus formally prescribed rules regulations word becomes bureaucratized Thus progressing business means result inexorable tendency inherent

Foreign Policy Boundaries State liberal there opposition between domestic policy foreign policy question often raised exhaustively discussed whether considerations foreign policy take precedence over

internal national unity greater stress they place necessity against foreign nations more urgently they call peace concord among members their nation this demand domestic unity liberal means opposes contrary demand peace within each nation itself outcome liberal thinking attained prominence only liberal ideas eighteenth century came more widely accepted Before liberal philosophy with unconditional extolment peace gained ascendancy over mens minds waging confined conflicts between country another Nations were themselves torn continual civil strife sanguinary internal struggles eighteenth century Briton still stood arrayed battle against Briton Culloden even late nineteenth century Germany while Prussia waged against Austria other German states joined fighting both sides that time Prussia nothing wrong fighting side Italy against German Austria only rapid progress events prevented Austria from joining French against Prussia allies Many victories which Prussian army proud were Prussian troops over those other German states liberalism that first taught nations preserve their internal conduct affairs peace that desires teach them keep also their relations with other countries from fact international division labor that liberalism derives decisive irrefutable argument against division labor long time gone beyond boundaries nation civilized nation today satisfies need selfsufficient community directly from production obliged obtain goods from abroad them exporting domestic products Anything that would have effect preventing stopping international exchange goods would immense damage whole human civilization undermine wellbeing indeed very basis existence millions upon millions people which nations mutually dependent products foreign provenance wars longer waged Since stoppage flow imports could have decisive effect outcome waged nation involved international division labor policy that wishes take into consideration possibility must endeavor make national economy selfsufficient must even time peace making international division labor come borders Germany wished withdraw from international division labor attempted satisfy needs directly through domestic production total annual product German labor would diminish thus wellbeing standard living cultural level German people would decline considerably Right already been pointed that country enjoy domestic peace only when democratic constitution provides guarantee that adjustment government will citizens take place without friction Nothing else required than consistent application same principle order assure international peace well liberals earlier thought that peoples world were peaceable nature that only monarchs desire order increase their power wealth conquest provinces They believed therefore that assure lasting peace sufficient replace rule dynastic princes governments dependent people democratic republic finds that existing boundaries shaped course history before

important motive waging already been excluded However this from being enough guarantee peace that exercise right reduced farce political institutions must such render transference sovereignty over

Examine linguistic national groups Central Eastern Europe notice often example northern western Bohemia boundaries between them crossed railway lines Here under conditions etatism there making borders state correspond linguistic frontier will operate Czech state railroad soil German state will even less railroad line that under different management every miles would just unthinkable after every minutes quarter hour railroad trip have face tariff barrier with formalities thus easy understand etatists reach conclusion that geographic economic unity such areas must ruptured that territory question must therefore placed under sovereignty single ruler Obviously every nation seeks prove that alone entitled competent play role ruler under such circumstances liberalism there problem here Private railroads quite free government interference traverse territory many states without trouble there tariff boundaries limitations movement persons animals goods then consequence whether train ride hours crosses over borders state more less often linguistic also reveals existence national enclaves Without land connection same nationality with main body their people compatriots dwell together closedoff settlements linguistic islands Under present political conditions they cannot incorporated into mother country fact that area encompassed state today protected tariff walls makes unbroken territorial continuity political necessity small foreign possession being isolated from immediately adjacent territory tariffs other measures protectionism would exposed economic strangulation once there free trade state restricts itself preservation private property nothing simpler than solution this problem linguistic island then acquiesce infringement rights nation merely because connected main body people territorial bridge inhabited fellow nationals notorious problem corridor also arises only system inland country believes that needs corridor order keep foreign trade free influence etatist policies countries whose territories separate from free trade were rule would hard what advantage inland country could expect from possession corridor Transfer from economic

today school attendance least private instruction compulsory Parents obliged send their children school certain number years lieu this public instruction school have them given equivalent instruction home pointless into reasons that were advanced against compulsory education when matter still live issue They have slightest relevance problem exists today There only argument that bearing this question that continued adherence policy compulsory education utterly incompatible with efforts establish lasting peace inhabitants London Paris Berlin will doubt find such statement completely incredible What world does compulsory education have with peace must however judge this question does many others exclusively from point view peoples Western Europe London Paris Berlin problem compulsory education sure easily solved these cities doubt arise which language used giving instruction population that lives these cities sends children school considered large homogeneous nationality even people live London find obvious interest their children that instruction given English other language things different Paris Berlin However problem compulsory education entirely different significance those extensive areas which peoples speaking different languages live together side side intermingled polyglot confusion Here question which language made basis instruction assumes crucial importance decision other over years determine nationality whole area school alienate children from nationality which their parents belong used means oppressing whole nationalities Whoever controls schools power injure other nationalities benefit solution this problem suggest that each child sent school which language parents spoken First even apart from problem posed children mixed linguistic background always easy decide what language parents polyglot areas many persons required their profession make languages spoken country Besides often possible regard means livelihoodto declare himself openly another nationality Under system could cost patronage customers belonging other nationalities with entrepreneur different nationality Then again there many parents would even prefer send their children schools another nationality than their because they value advantages bilingualism assimilation other nationality more highly than loyalty their people leaves parents choice school which they wish send their children then exposes them every conceivable form political coercion areas mixed nationality school political prize highest importance cannot deprived political character long remains public compulsory institution There fact only solution state government laws must concern themselves with schooling education Public funds must used such purposes rearing instruction youth must left entirely parents private associations institutions better that number boys grow without formal education than that they enjoy benefit schooling only risk once they have grown being killed maimed healthy illiterate always better than literate cripple even eliminate spiritual coercion exercised compulsory education should still from having done everything that

history steeped further blood than history colonialism Blood shed uselessly senselessly Flourishing lands were laid waste whole peoples destroyed exterminated this extenuated justified dominion Europeans Africa important parts Asia absolute stands sharpest contrast principles liberalism democracy there doubt that must strive abolition only question elimination this intolerable condition accomplished least harmful possible most simple radical solution would European governments withdraw their officials soldiers police from these areas leave inhabitants themselves consequence whether this done immediately whether freely held plebiscite natives made precede surrender colonies there scarcely doubt outcome truly free election European rule overseas colonies cannot count consent subjects immediate consequence this radical solution would outright anarchy then least continual conflicts areas evacuated Europeans safely taken granted that natives have learned only evil ways from Europeans good ones This fault natives rather their European conquerors have taught them nothing evil They have brought arms engines destruction kinds colonies they have sent their worst most brutal individuals officials officers point sword they have colonial rule that sanguinary cruelty rivals despotic system Bolsheviks Europeans must surprised example that they themselves have their colonies bears evil fruit case they have right complain pharisaically about state public morals among natives would they justified maintaining that natives mature enough freedom that they still need least several years further education under lash foreign rulers before they capable being left their this education itself least partly responsible terrible conditions that exist today colonies even though consequences will make themselves fully apparent until after eventual withdrawal European troops officials perhaps will contended that duty Europeans members superior race avoid anarchy that would presumably break after evacuation colonies therefore maintain their dominion interests benefit natives themselves order strengthen this argument lurid picture painted conditions that existed Central Africa many parts Asia before establishment European rule recall hunts slaves conducted Arabs Central Africa wanton outrages that many Indian despots allowed themselves course there much that hypocritical this mode argumentation should forget example that slave trade Africa could prosper only because descendants Europeans American colonies entered slave market buyers necessary into pros cons this line reasoning that adduced favor maintenance European rule colonies supposed interest natives then must that would better this rule were brought completely right thrust himself into affairs others order further their interest ought when interests view pretend that acting selflessly only interest others There however another argument favor continuance European authority influence colonial areas Europeans never brought tropical colonies under their dominion they made their economic system dependent considerable extent importation tropical materials overseas agricultural products that they paid with industrial goods would still possible discuss quite calmly question whether advisable draw these areas into network world market since colonization already forced these territories into framework worldwide economic community situation quite different economy Europe today based great extent inclusion Africa large parts Asia world economy suppliers materials kinds These materials taken from natives these areas force They carried away tribute handed over voluntary exchange industrial products Europe Thus relations founded onesided advantage they contrary mutually beneficial inhabitants colonies derive from them just many advantages inhabitants England Switzerland stoppage these trade relations would involve serious economic losses Europe well colonies would sharply depress standard living great masses people slow extension economic relations over whole earth gradual development world economy most important sources increasing wealth last hundred fifty years reversal this trend would represent world economic catastrophe hitherto unprecedented proportions extent consequences this catastrophe would exceed crisis connected with economic consequences World Ought wellbeing Europe same time that colonies well allowed decline further order give natives chance determine their political destinies when this would lead event their freedom merely change masters This consideration that must decisive judging questions colonial policy European officials troops police must remain these areas their presence necessary order maintain legal political conditions

thence Europe America That this should continue possible interest everyone only inhabitants Europe America Australia also natives Asia Africa themselves Wherever colonial powers beyond this treatment their colonies raise objection their activities even from liberal standpoint everyone knows seriously colonial powers have sinned against this principle hardly necessary recall horrors that trustworthy English correspondents have reported having been perpetrated Belgian Congo assume that these atrocities were intended Belgian government only attributed excesses evil characters functionaries sent Congo very fact that almost colonial powers have established their overseas possessions commercial system that grants favored position goods mother country shows that presentday colonial policy dominated considerations altogether different from those that ought prevail this field order bring interests Europe white race into harmony with those colored races colonies regard

protect them against having make sacrifices quell native uprisings natives could only grateful proposal that would assure them independence peaceful evolution with guarantee that neighbor bent conquest would threaten their political independence future Free Trade theoretical demonstration consequences protective tariff free trade keystone classical economics clear obvious indisputable that opponents were unable advance arguments against that could immediately refuted completely mistaken absurd Nevertheless nowadays find protective tariffsindeed often even outright prohibitions importsall over world Even England mother country free trade protectionism ascendancy today principle national autarky wins supporters with every that passes Even countries with only million inhabitants like Hungary Czechoslovakia attempting means hightariff policy prohibitions imports make themselves independent rest world basic idea foreign trade policy United States impose goods produced abroad lower costs import duties full amount this difference What renders whole situation grotesque fact that countries want decrease their imports same time increase their exports effect these policies interfere with international division labor thereby generally lower productivity labor only reason this result become more noticeable that advances capitalist system have always been sufficient outweigh However there doubt that everyone today would richer protective tariff artificially drive production from more favorable less favorable localities Under system completely free trade capital labor would employed wherever conditions most favorable production Other locations would used long still possible produce anywhere under more favorable conditions extent which result development means transportation improvements technology more thorough exploration countries newly opened commerce discovered that there sites more favorable production than those currently being used production shifts these localities Capital labor tend move from areas where conditions less favorable production those which they more favorable migration capital labor presupposes only complete freedom trade also complete absence obstacles their movement from country another This from being case time that classical freetrade doctrine first developed whole series obstacles stood free movement both capital labor Because ignorance conditions general insecurity regard order number similar reasons capitalists felt reluctant about investing foreign countries workers they found impossible leave their native land only because their ignorance foreign languages because legal religious other difficulties beginning nineteenth century sure generally true that capital labor could move freely within each country obstacles stood their movement from country another sole justification distinguishing economic theory between domestic foreign trade found fact that case former there free mobility capital labor whereas this true regard commerce between nations Thus problem that classical theory solve stated follows What effects free trade consumers goods between country another mobility capital labor from other restricted this question Ricardos doctrine provided answer branches production distribute themselves among individual countries such that each country devotes resources those industries which possesses greatest superiority over other countries mercantilists feared that country with unfavorable conditions production would import more than would export that would ultimately find itself without money they demanded that protective tariffs prohibitions imports decreed time prevent such deplorable situation from arising classical doctrine shows that these mercantilist fears were groundless even country which conditions production every branch industry less favorable than they other countries need fear that will export less than will import classical doctrine demonstrated brilliant that never been contested anybody that even countries with relatively favorable conditions production must find advantageous import from countries with comparatively unfavorable conditions production those commodities that they would sure better fitted produce much better fitted they produce other commodities whose production they then specialize Thus what classical theory free trade says statesman There countries with relatively favorable others with relatively unfavorable natural conditions production absence interference part governments international division labor will itself result every countrys finding place world economy matter conditions production compare with those other countries course countries with comparatively favorable conditions production will richer than others this fact that cannot altered political measures case simply consequence difference natural factors production This situation that confronted older liberalism this situation responded with classical doctrine free trade since days Ricardo world conditions have changed considerably problem that freetrade doctrine face last sixty years before outbreak World completely different from with which deal close eighteenth beginning nineteenth century nineteenth century partially eliminated obstacles that beginning stood free mobility capital labor second half nineteenth century easier capitalist invest capital abroad than been Ricardos order were established considerably firmer foundation knowledge foreign countries manners customs spread jointstock company offered possibility dividing risk foreign enterprises among many persons thereby reducing would course exaggeration that beginning twentieth century capital mobile passage from country another within territory country itself Certain differences still existed sure assumption that capital remain within boundaries each country longer valid this longer true labor either second half nineteenth century millions left Europe find better opportunities employment overseas conditions presupposed classical doctrine free trade immobility capital labor longer existed distinction between effects free trade domestic commerce foreign commerce likewise necessarily lost validity capital labor move freely between country another they within confines each then there further justification making distinction between effects free trade domestic commerce foreign commerce then what said regard former holds latter well result free trade that only those locations used production which conditions comparatively favorable while those which conditions production comparatively unfavorable remain unused Capital labor flow from countries with less favorable conditions production toward those where conditions production more favorable more precisely from longsettled thickly populated European countries toward America Australia areas that offer more favorable conditions production European nations that their disposal besides areas settlement Europe overseas territories suitable colonization Europeans this meant nothing more than that they settled part their population overseas Englands case example some sons lived Canada Australia South Africa emigrants left England could retain their English citizenship nationality their homes Germany case quite different German emigrated landed territory foreign country found himself among members foreign nation became citizen foreign state expected that after most three generations attachment German people would dissolved process assimilation member foreign nation would completed Germany faced with problem whether look with indifference while part capital people emigrated overseas must fall into error assuming that problems commercial policy that England Germany face second half nineteenth century were same England question whether ought permit number sons emigrate dominions there reason hinder their emigration Germany however problem whether ought stand quietly while nationals emigrated British colonies South America other countries where expected that these emigrants course time would give their citizenship nationality just hundreds thousands indeed millions previously emigrated already done Because want this happen German Empire which during sixties seventies been approaching ever more closely policy free trade shifted toward seventies protectionism imposition import duties designed shield German agriculture industry against foreign competition Under protection these tariffs German agriculture able some extent bear EastEuropean overseas competition from farms operating better land German industry could form cartels that kept domestic price above price world market enabling profits thereby realized undersell competitors abroad ultimate goal that aimed return protectionism could achieved higher living production costs rose Germany direct consequence these protective tariffs more difficult trade position necessarily became sure possible Germany make mighty industrial upswing first three decades commercial policy this upswing would have occurred even absence protective tariff primarily result introduction methods German iron chemical industries which enabled them make better countrys abundant natural resources Antiliberal policy abolishing free mobility labor international trade considerably restricting even mobility capital certain extent eliminated difference that existed conditions international trade between beginning nineteenth century reverted those prevailing time doctrine free trade first formulated Once again capital above labor hindered their movements Under conditions existing today unhampered trade consumers goods could give rise migratory movements Once again would result state affairs which individual peoples world would engaged those types branches production which relatively best conditions exist their countries whatever prerequisites development international trade protective tariffs accomplish only thing prevent production from being carried where natural social conditions most favorable cause carried instead where conditions worse outcome protectionism therefore always reduction productivity human labor freetrader from denying that evil that nations world wish combat means policy protectionism really evil What maintains only that means recommended imperialists protectionists cannot eliminate that evil therefore proposes different order create indispensable conditions lasting peace features present international situation that liberal wishes change fact that emigrants from nations like Germany Italy which have been treated like stepchildren division world must live areas which because adoption antiliberal policies they condemned lose their nationality Freedom Movement Liberalism sometimes been reproached ground that program predominantly negative This follows necessarily asserted from very nature freedom which conceived only freedomfrom something demand freedom consists essentially rejection some sort claim other hand thought program authoritarian parties positive Since very definite value judgment generally connoted terms negative positive this speaking already involves surreptitious attempt discredit political program liberalism There need repeat here once again that liberal programa society based private ownership means productionis less positive than other conceivable political program What negative liberal program denial rejection combating everything that stands opposition this positive program this defensive posture program liberalismand that matter that every movementis dependent position that opponents assume towards Where opposition strongest assault liberalism must also strongest where relatively weak even completely lacking brief words under circumstances sufficient since opposition that liberalism confront changed during course history defensive aspect liberal program also undergone many changes This becomes most clearly evident stand that takes regard question freedom movement liberal demands that every person have right live wherever wants This negative demand belongs very essence society based private ownership means production that every work dispose earnings where thinks best This principle takes negative character only encounters forces aiming restriction freedom movement this negative aspect right freedom movement course time undergone complete change When liberalism arose eighteenth nineteenth centuries struggle freedom emigration Today struggle over freedom immigration that time oppose laws which hindered inhabitants country from moving city which held prospect severe punishment anyone wanted leave native land order better himself foreign land Immigration however that time generally free unhampered Today well known things quite different trend began some decades with laws against immigration Chinese coolies Today every country world that could appear inviting immigration there more less stringent laws either prohibiting entirely least restricting severely This policy must considered from points view first policy trade unions then policy national protectionism Aside from such coercive measures closed shop compulsory strikes violent interference with those willing work only trade unions have influence labor market restricting supply labor since within power trade unions reduce number workers living world only other possibility remaining open them block access employment thus diminish number workers branch industry country expense workers employed other industries living other countries reasons practical politics possible only limited extent those engaged particular branch industry from rest workers country other hand special political difficulty involved imposing such restrictions entrance foreign labor natural conditions production concomitantly productivity labor more favorable consequence wage rates higher United States than vast areas Europe absence immigration barriers European workers would emigrate United States great numbers look jobs American immigration laws make this exceptionally difficult Thus wages labor United States kept above height that they would reach there were full freedom migration whereas Europe they depressed below this height hand American worker gains other hand European worker loses However would mistake consider consequences immigration barriers exclusively from point view their immediate effect wages They further result relative oversupply labor areas with comparatively unfavorable conditions production relative shortage labor areas which conditions production comparatively favorable production further expanded former more restricted latter than would case there were full freedom migration Thus effects restricting this freedom just same those protective tariff part world comparatively favorable opportunities production utilized while another part world less favorable opportunities production being exploited Looked from standpoint humanity result lowering productivity human labor reduction supply goods disposal mankind Attempts justify economic grounds policy restricting immigration therefore doomed from outset There cannot slightest doubt that migration barriers diminish productivity human labor When trade unions United States Australia hinder immigration they fighting only against interests workers rest countries world also against interests everyone else order secure special privilege themselves that still remains quite uncertain whether increase general productivity human labor which could brought about establishment complete freedom migration would great compensate entirely members American Australian trade unions losses that they could suffer from immigration foreign workers workers United States Australia could succeed having restrictions imposed immigration they have still another argument fall back upon support their policy After even today power certain liberal principles ideas great that cannot combat them does place allegedly higher more important considerations above interest attainment maximum productivity have already seen national interests cited justification protective tariffs same considerations also invoked favor restrictions immigration absence migration barriers whatsoever vast hordes immigrants from comparatively overpopulated areas Europe would maintained inundate Australia America They would come such great numbers that would longer possible count their assimilation past immigrants America soon adopted English language American ways customs this part fact that they come over once such great numbers small groups immigrants distributed themselves over wide land quickly integrated themselves into great body American people individual immigrant already half assimilated when next immigrants landed American soil most important reasons this rapid national assimilation fact that immigrants from foreign countries come great numbers This believed would change there real danger that ascendancyor more correctly exclusive dominionof AngloSaxons United States would destroyed This especially feared case heavy immigration part Mongolian peoples Asia These fears perhaps exaggerated regard United States regards Australia they certainly Australia approximately same number inhabitants Austria area however hundred times greater than Austrias natural resources certainly incomparably richer Australia were thrown open immigration assumed with great probability that population would years consist mostly Japanese Chinese Malayans aversion that most people feel today towards members foreign nationalities especially towards those other races evidently great admit peaceful settlement such antagonisms scarcely expected that Australians will voluntarily permit immigration Europeans English nationality completely question that they should permit Asiatics seek work permanent home their continent Australians English descent insist that fact that English first opened this land settlement given English people special right exclusive possession entire continent time come members worlds other nationalities however least desire contest right Australians occupy land that they already making Australia They think only that unfair that Australians permit utilization more favorable conditions production that today fallow force them carry production under less favorable conditions prevailing their countries This issue most momentous significance future world Indeed fate civilization depends satisfactory resolution side stand scores indeed hundreds millions Europeans Asiatics compelled work under less favorable conditions production than they could find territories from which they barred They demand that gates forbidden paradise opened them that they increase productivity their labor thereby receive themselves higher standard living other side stand those already fortunate enough call their land with more favorable conditions production They desireas they workers owners means productionnot give higher wages that this position guarantees them entire nation however unanimous fearing inundation foreigners present inhabitants these favored lands fear that some they could reduced minority their country that they would then have suffer horrors national persecution which instance Germans today exposed Czechoslovakia Italy Poland cannot denied that these fears justified Because enormous power that today stands command state national

foreign nationality positively terrifying frightful live state which every turn exposed under guise justiceby ruling majority dreadful handicapped even child school account ones nationality wrong

numbers will defeated that example nations Asia counting hundreds millions will succeed driving progeny white race from Australia wish indulge such conjectures certain that such warsand must assume that world problem such great dimensions cannot solved once just warwould lead most frightful catastrophe civilization clear that solution problem immigration possible adheres ideal state which meddles every field human activity that socialist state Only adoption liberal program could make problem immigration which today seems insoluble completely disappear Australia governed according liberal principles what difficulties could arise from fact that some parts continent Japanese other parts Englishmen were majority United States Europe United States America mightiest richest nation world Nowhere else capitalism able develop more freely with less interference from government inhabitants United States America therefore richer than those other country earth more than sixty years their country involved they waged extermination against original inhabitants land they needlessly waged against Spain they participated World only graybeards among them would today able give firsthand

similar size that formed future perhaps South America They must therefore consolidate into military political union into defensive offensive alliance which alone would capable assuring Europe

more nearly correct that these Russian ideas themselves were originally Russian however much they have suited character Russian people that they were borrowed Russians from Europe great intellectual sterility Russians that they were never able formulate themselves expression their inmost nature Liberalism which based completely science whose policies represent nothing application results science

improvement general wellbeing civilization would rise ever higher levels culture Nothing could shake their optimism attack liberalism began grow steadily fiercer ascendancy liberal ideas politics challenged from sides they thought that what they contend with only last volleys fired retreat moribund system that require serious study counterattack because would case soon collapse itself liberals were opinion that have intellectual capacity reason correctly about difficult problems social cooperation accordingly They were impressed with clarity selfevidence reasoning which they arrived their political ideas that they were quite unable understand anyone could fail comprehend They never grasped facts first that masses lack capacity think logically secondly that eyes most people even when they able recognize truth momentary special advantage that enjoyed immediately appears more important than lasting greater gain that must deferred Most people have even intellectual endowments required think through theafter very social cooperation they certainly have will power necessary make those provisional sacrifices that social action demands slogans socialism especially proposals partial expropriation private property always find ready enthusiastic approval with masses expect profit directly immediately from them Political Parties There more grievous meaning nature liberalism than think that would possible secure victory liberal ideas resorting methods employed today other political parties caste status society constituted citizens with equal rights divided into ranks vested with different duties prerogatives there political parties modern sense long special privileges immunities different castes called into question peace reigns among them once privileges caste status contested issue joined civil avoided only side other recognizing weakness yields without appeal arms such conflicts position each individual determined from outset status member caste another

individual confronted with question which opposing groups ought join stands members caste shares their fate caste castes that dissatisfied with their position rebel against prevailing order have their demands against opposition others ultimate outcome conflict isif everything does fact remain because rebels have been worstedthat order replaced which rights various castes different from what they were before With advent liberalism came demand abolition special privileges society caste status make order which there were only citizens with equal rights What under attack longer only particular privileges different castes very existence privileges Liberalism tore down barriers rank status liberated from restrictions with which order surrounded capitalist society under system government founded liberal principles that individual first granted opportunity participate directly political life first called upon make personal decision regard political goals ideals caste status society earlier days only political conflicts been those among different castes each which formed solid front opposition others absence such conflicts there were within those castes that were permitted share political life factional conflicts among coteries cliques influence power place helm Only under polity which citizens enjoy equal liberal ideal which nowhere ever been fully achievedcan there political parties consisting associations persons want their ideas legislation administration into effect there very well differences opinion concerning best achieve liberal assuring peaceful social cooperation these differences opinion must join issue conflicts ideas Thus liberal society there could socialist parties Even parties that seek have special legal position conceded particular groups would impossible under liberal system these parties must acknowledge liberalism least temporarily until they emerge victorious make their political struggles solely weapons intellect which liberalism views only ones permissible such contests even though last analysis socialists champions special privileges members antiliberal parties reject liberal philosophy Thus some preMarxist utopian socialists fought socialism within framework liberalism golden liberalism western Europe clergy nobility tried achieve their ends within framework modern constitutional state parties that work today entirely different kind sure some part their program concerned with whole society purports address itself problem social cooperation achieved what this part their program says only concession wrung from them liberal ideology What they reality forth another part their program which only part that they attention which stands irreconcilable contradiction part that couched terms general welfare Presentday political parties champions only certain privileged orders earlier days that desire preserved extended traditional prerogatives that liberalism allow them keep because victory complete also certain groups that strive special privileges that that desire attain status caste Liberalism addresses itself proposes program acceptable alike promises privileges calling renunciation pursuit special interests even demands sacrifices though course only provisional ones involving giving relatively small advantage order attain greater parties special interests address themselves only part society this part which alone they intend work they promise special advantages expense rest society modern political parties modern party ideologies originated reaction part special group interests fighting privileged status against liberalism Before rise liberalism there were course privileged orders with their special interests prerogatives their mutual conflicts that time ideology status society could still express itself completely naive unembarrassed conflicts that occurred those days between champions opponents special privilege there never question antisocial character whole system need maintaining pretense justifying social grounds cannot therefore draw direct comparison between system privileged orders activities propaganda presentday parties special interests understand true character these parties must keep mind fact that they were originally formed solely defense special privileges against teachings liberalism Their party doctrines like those liberalism political application comprehensive carefully thoughtout theory society political ideology liberalism derived from fundamental system ideas that first been developed scientific theory without thought political significance this special rights privileges sought antiliberal parties were from very outset already realized existing social institutions justification latter that undertook subsequently elaborate ideology task that generally treated matter little moment that could easily disposed with brief words Farm groups think sufficient point agriculture trade unions appeal labor parties middle class cite importance existence social stratum that represents golden mean seems trouble them little that such appeals contribute nothing province necessity even general public special privileges they striving groups that they desire over will follow them case others every attempt recruiting supporters from their ranks would futile Thus these modern parties special interests matter apart their goals diverge violently they contend against another form united front battle against liberalism eyes them principle liberalism that rightly understood interests long compatible like cloth waved front bull they there irreconcilable conflicts interests that settled only victory faction over others advantage former disadvantage latter Liberalism these parties assert what pretends nothing party program seeking champion special interests particular group bourgeoisie capitalists entrepreneurs against interests other groups fact that this allegation forms part propaganda Marxism accounts much latters success doctrine irreconcilable conflict between interests different classes within society based private ownership means production taken essential dogma Marxism then parties active today European continent would have considered Marxist doctrine class antagonisms class conflict also accepted nationalist parties they share opinion that these antagonisms exist capitalist society that conflicts which they give rise must their course What distinguishes them from Marxist parties only that they wish overcome class conflict reverting status society constituted along lines that they recommend shifting battlefront international arena where they believe should They dispute statement that conflicts this kind occur society based private ownership means production They merely contend that such antagonisms ought arise order eliminate them they want guide regulate private property acts government interference they want place capitalism last analysis this different from what Marxists They promise lead world social order which there will more classes class antagonisms class conflicts order grasp meaning doctrine class must bear mind that directed against liberal doctrine harmony rightly understood interests members free society founded principle private ownership means production liberals maintained that with elimination artificial distinctions caste status abolition privileges establishment equality before nothing else stands peaceful cooperation members society because then their rightly understood longrun interests coincide objections that champions feudalism special privileges distinctions caste status sought advance against this doctrine soon proved quite unjustified were unable gain notable support Ricardos system catallactics find point departure theory conflict interests within capitalist system Ricardo believed that could show course progressive economic development shift takes place relations among three forms income system profit rent wages this that impelled English writers third fourth decades nineteenth century speak three classes capitalists landowners wagelaborers maintain that irreconcilable antagonism exists among these groups This line thought later taken Marx Communist Manifesto Marx still distinguish between caste class Only later when became acquainted London with writings forgotten pamphleteers twenties thirties under their influence began study Ricardos system realize that problem this case show that even society without caste distinctions privileges irreconcilable conflicts still exist This antagonism interests deduced from Ricardos system distinguishing among three classes capitalists landowners workers means adhered firmly this distinction Sometimes asserts that there only classes propertied propertyless other times distinguishes among more classes than just three great ones time however Marx many followers attempt define concept nature classes significant that chapter entitled Classes third volume Capital breaks after sentences More than generation elapsed from appearance Communist Manifesto which Marx first makes class antagonism class keystone entire doctrine time death During this entire period Marx wrote volume after volume never came point explaining what understood class treatment problem classes Marx never went beyond mere statement without proof dogma rather slogan order prove that doctrine class warfare true would have able establish facts hand that there identity interests among members each class other hand that what benefits class injures other This however never been accomplished Indeed never even been attempted Precisely because class comrades same social situation there identity interests among them rather competition worker example employed under conditions interest excluding competitors could reduce income average level decades when doctrine international solidarity proletariat proclaimed time time again verbose resolutions adopted international Marxist congresses workers United States Australia greatest obstacles immigration means complex network petty regulations English trade unions made impossible entrance outsiders into their branches labor What been done labor parties this regard every country during last years well known course that this ought have happened workers ought have acted differently what they wrong cannot deny that directly served their interestsat least moment Liberalism demonstrated that antagonism interests which according widely prevalent opinion supposed exist among different persons groups strata within society based private ownership means production does fact occur increase total capital raises income capitalists landowners absolutely that workers both absolutely relatively regards their income shifts various interests different groups strata societythe entrepreneurs capitalists landowners workersoccur together move same direction they pass through different phases their fluctuations what varies only ratio their shares social product interests landowners oppose those members other groups only case genuine monopoly certain mineral interests entrepreneurs never diverge from those consumers entrepreneur prospers better better able anticipate desires consumers Conflicts interests occur only restrictions owners free disposal means production imposed policy government interference part other social forces armed with coercive power example price certain article artificially raised protective tariff wages certain group workers increased excluding competitors their jobs famous line reasoning freetrade school never refuted forever irrefutable applies cases this kind Such special privileges course benefit particular group whose behalf they were instituted only other groups have been unable similar privileges themselves cannot assumed that would possible longrun deceive majority people about real significance such special privileges that they will tolerate them willingly undertakes force compel their acceptance will provoke violent rebellionin short disturbance peaceful course social cooperation preservation which interest everyone seeks solve problem making these special privileges exceptions behalf just persons groups strata society general rule example resorting import duties protect most articles sold home market using similar measures access majority occupations advantages gained each particular group disadvantages that they must suffer result only that injured consequent lowering productivity labor rejects this doctrine liberalism heaps ridicule controversial theory harmony interests then true either wrongly assumed schools antiliberal thought that there could still solidarity interests within narrower circles instance among members same nation against other nations among members same class against other classes order demonstrate existence such alleged solidarity special line reasoning would necessary that followed even attempted follow arguments that could employed prove existence solidarity interests among members these groups prove much more besides universal solidarity interests within ecumenical society those apparent conflicts interest that seem first sight irreconcilable fact resolved shown only means line reasoning that treats mankind essentially harmonious community allows room demonstration irreconcilable antagonisms among nations classes races like antiliberal parties they believe prove that there solidarity interests within nations classes races that they actually recommend members these particular groups alliances common struggle against other groups When they speak solidarity interests within these groups they much affirming fact stating postulate reality they saying interests identical rather interests ought made identical alliance united action modern parties special interests declare quite frankly unequivocally from very outset that their policy creation special privileges particular group Agrarian parties strive protective tariffs other advantages subsidies farmers civil service parties securing privileges bureaucrats regional parties dedicated gaining special advantages inhabitants certain region these parties evidently seek nothing advantage single group society without consideration whole society other groups however much they seek palliate their procedure declaring that welfare whole society achieved only furthering interests agriculture civil service Indeed their exclusive concern with single segment society their labors endeavors behalf alone have become increasingly obvious more cynical with passage years When modern antiliberal movements were still their infancy they more circumspect regard such matters because Generation that been reared liberal philosophy learned look upon undisguised advocacy special interests various groups antisocial champions special interests form great parties only composing single combat unit combined forces various groups whose special interests conflict Privileges granted particular group however have practical value only when they accrue minority outweighed privileges granted another group unless circumstances exceptionally favorable small group cannot hope present while liberal condemnation privileges nobility still retains some traces earlier influence able have their claim treated privileged class prevail against other groups problem parties special interests therefore form great parties relatively small groups with differing indeed directly conflicting interests view mentality that leads these smaller parties forth defend their demands special privileges quite impracticable achieve this open alliance among various groups provisional sacrifice asked strives acquisition privileged position group even himself alone were capable understanding reason making provisional sacrifice then would certainly think along liberal lines terms demands those engaged scramble special privileges openly tell that will gain more from privilege intended than will lose from privileges that will have concede others speeches writings this effect could long remain hidden from others would impel them raise their demands even higher Thus parties special interests obliged cautious speaking this most important point their endeavors they must resort ambiguous expressions intended obscure true state affairs Protectionist parties best example this kind equivocation They must always careful represent interest protective tariffs they recommend that wider group When associations manufacturers advocate protective tariffs party leaders generally take care mention that interests individual groups often even individual concerns means identical harmonious weaver injured tariffs machines yarn will promote protectionist movement only expectation that textile tariffs will high enough compensate loss that suffers from other tariffs farmer grows fodder demands tariffs fodder which cattle raisers oppose winegrower demands tariff wine which just farmer does happen cultivate vineyard urban consumer Nevertheless protectionists appear single party united behind common program This made possible only throwing veil obscurity over truth matter attempt found party special interests basis equal apportionment privileges among majority population would utterly senseless privilege accruing majority ceases such predominantly agricultural country which exports farm products agrarian party working special favors farmers would long impossible What should demand Protective tariffs could benefit these farmers must export subsidies could paid majority producers because minority could provide them minority other hand which demands privileges itself must induce illusion that great masses stand behind When agrarian parties industrial countries present their demands they include what they call farm population landless workers cottagers owners small plots land have interest protective tariff agricultural products When labor parties make some demand behalf group workers they always talk great mass working people gloss over fact that interests tradeunionists employed different branches production identical contrary actually antagonistic that even within individual industries concerns there sharp conflicts interest This fundamental weaknesses parties aiming privileges behalf special interests hand they obliged rely only small group because privileges cease privileges when they granted majority other hand only their guise champions majority that they have prospect realizing their demands fact that many parties different countries have sometimes succeeded overcoming this difficulty carrying their propaganda have managed imbue each social stratum group with conviction that members expect special advantages from triumph party speaks only diplomatic tactical skill leadership want judgment political immaturity voting masses means proves that real solution problem fact possible course simultaneously promise citydwellers cheaper bread farmers higher prices grain cannot keep both promises same time easy enough promise group that will support increase certain government expenditures without corresponding reduction other government expenditures same time hold another group prospect lower taxes cannot keep both these promises same time either technique these parties based division society into producers consumers They also wont make usual hypostasis state questions fiscal policy that enables them advocate expenditures paid public treasury without particular concern their part over such expenses defrayed same time complain about heavy burden taxes other basic defect these parties that demands they raise each particular group limitless There their eyes only limit quantity demanded resistance other side This entirely keeping with their character parties striving privileges behalf special interests parties that follow definite program come into conflict pursuit unlimited desires privileges behalf some legal disabilities others must bring about destruction every political system People have been coming recognize this ever more clearly have begun speak crisis modern state crisis parliamentary system reality what involved crisis ideologies modern parties special interests Crisis Idea Diet Representing Special Groups slowly developed England some colonies since seventeenth century European continent since overthrow Napoleon July February Revolutions presupposes general acceptance ideology liberalism enter parliament charged with responsibility there deciding country shall governed must imbued with conviction that rightly understood interests parts members society coincide that every kind special privilege particular groups classes population detrimental common good must eliminated different parties parliament empowered perform functions assigned constitutions recent times course take different sides regard particular political questions they must consider themselves whole nation particular districts social strata Above their differences opinion there must prevail conviction that last analysis they united common purpose identical that only means attainment goal toward which they aspire dispute parties separated unbridgeable gulf conflicts interests that they prepared carry bitter even this means that whole nation must suffer country brought ruin What divides parties position they take regard concrete problems policy There therefore only parties party power that wants power Even opposition does seek obtain power order promote certain interests fill official posts with party members order translate ideas into legislation them into effect administration country Only under these conditions parliaments parliamentary governments practicable time they were realized AngloSaxon countries some traces them still found there today European continent even during period usually characterized golden liberalism could really speak only certain approximation these conditions decades conditions popular assemblies Europe have been something like their direct opposite There great number parties each particular party itself divided into various subgroups which generally present united front outside world usually oppose another within party councils vehemently they oppose other parties publicly Each particular party faction feels itself appointed sole champion certain special interests which undertakes lead victory cost allot much possible from public coffers favor them protective tariffs immigration barriers social legislation privileges kinds expense rest society whole substance their policy their demands principle limitless impossible these parties ever achieve ends envisages unthinkable that what agrarian labor parties strive could ever entirely realized Every party seeks nevertheless attain such influence will permit satisfy desires possible while also taking care always able justify electors their wishes could fulfilled This done either seeking give public appearance being opposition although party actually power striving shift blame some force answerable influence sovereign monarchical state under certain circumstances foreign powers like Bolsheviks cannot make Russia happy socialists Austria because western capitalism prevents least fifty years antiliberal parties have ruled Germany Austria still read their manifestoes public statements even those their scientific champions that existing evils blamed dominance liberal principles parliament composed supporters antiliberal parties special interests capable carrying business must long disappoint everyone This what people mean today have meant many years when they speak crisis solution this crisis some demand abolition democracy parliamentary system institution dictatorship propose discuss once again objections dictatorship This have already done sufficient detail second suggestion directed toward remedying alleged deficiencies general assembly composed members elected directly citizens either supplementing replacing altogether with diet composed delegates chosen autonomous corporative bodies guilds formed different branches trade industry professions members general popular assembly said lack requisite objectivity knowledge economic affairs What needed much general policy economic policy industrial professional guilds would able come agreement questions whose solution either eludes entirely delegates constituencies formed merely geographical basis becomes apparent them only after long delay regard assembly composed delegates representing different occupational associations crucial question about which must clear vote taken each member have vote many granted each guild This problem that must resolved before diet convenes once this question settled spare oneself trouble calling assembly into session outcome voting thereby already determined sure quite another question whether distribution power among guilds once established maintained will always belet cherish delusions this majority people order create parliament acceptable majority there need assembly divided along occupational lines Everything will depend whether discontent aroused policies adopted deputies guilds great enough lead violent overthrow whole system contrast democratic system this offers guarantee that change policy desired overwhelming majority population will take place saying this have said everything that needs said against idea assembly constituted basis occupational divisions liberal system which does exclude every violent interruption peaceful development from very outset question Many supporters idea diet composed guild think that conflicts should settled submission faction another mutual adjustment differences what supposed happen parties cannot succeed reaching agreement Compromises come about only when threatening specter unfavorable issue induces each party dispute make some concession prevents different parties from coming agreement even parliament composed delegates elected directly whole nation will able compel agreement diet consisting deputies chosen members occupational associations Thus assembly constituted cannot function like parliament that serves organ democratic system cannot place where differences political opinion peacefully adjusted position prevent violent interruption peaceful progress society insurrection revolution civil crucial decisions that determine distribution political power state made within chambers during elections that decide composition decisive factor determining distribution power relative weight assigned constitution different corporate associations shaping public policy this matter that decided outside chambers diet without organic relationship elections which members chosen therefore quite correct withhold name parliament from assembly consisting corporate associations organized along occupational lines Political terminology been accustomed last centuries make sharp distinction between parliament such assembly does wish confound concepts political science does well adhere this distinction Sidney Beatrice Webb well number syndicalists guild socialists following this respect already made earlier days many continental advocates reform upper chamber have proposed letting chambers exist side side elected directly whole nation other composed deputies elected from constituencies divided along occupational lines However obvious that this suggestion remedies defects system guild representation practice bicameral System function only house upper hand unconditional power impose will other when chambers take different positions issue attempt compromise solution must made absence such attempt however conflict remains settled outside chambers parliament last resort force alone Twist turn problem will always returns same insurmountable difficulties Such stumbling blocks which proposals this similar kind must come grief whether they called corporativism guild socialism anything else these schemes admitted when people finally content themselves recommending completely innovation establishment economic council empowered serve solely advisory capacity champions idea assembly composed guild deputies labor under serious delusion they think that antagonisms that today rend fabric national unity overcome dividing population popular assembly along occupational lines cannot these antagonisms tinkering with technicalities constitution They overcome only liberal ideology Liberalism Parties Special Interests parties special interests which nothing more politics than securing privileges prerogatives their groups only make parliamentary system impossible they rupture unity state society They lead merely crisis general political social crisis Society cannot long exist divided into sharply defined groups each intent wresting special privileges members continually alert that does suffer setback prepared moment sacrifice most important political institutions sake winning some petty advantage parties special interests political questions appear exclusively problems political tactics Their ultimate goal fixed them from start Their obtain cost rest population greatest possible advantages privileges groups they represent party platform intended disguise this objective give certain appearance justification under circumstances announce publicly goal party policy members party case know what their goal they need have explained them much ought imparted world however purely tactical question antiliberal parties want nothing secure special favors their members complete disregard resulting disintegration whole structure society They cannot withstand moment criticism that liberalism makes their aims They cannot deny when their demands subjected test logical scrutiny that their activity last analysis antisocial destructive effects that even most cursory examination must prove impossible social order arise from operations parties special interests continually working against another sure obviousness these facts been able damage parties special interests eyes those lack capacity look beyond immediate present great mass people inquire what will happen after tomorrow later They think today most next They what must follow other groups pursuit their special interests were display same unconcern general welfare They hope succeed only realizing their demands also beating down those others apply higher standards activities political parties demand that even political action categorical imperative followed only that principle which will same time universal that contradiction results from attempt conceive your action universally complied with ideology parties special interests certainly nothing offer Socialism gained considerable advantage from this logical deficiency position adopted parties special interests many unable grasp great ideal liberalism think clearly content with demands privileged treatment behalf particular groups principle socialism took special significance idea socialist societyto which cannot spite necessarily inherent defects which have already discussed detail deny certain grandeur conceal same time vindicate weakness position taken parties special interests effect diverting attention critic from activities party great problem which whatever think events deserving serious exhaustive consideration last hundred years socialist ideal form another found adherents among many sincere honest people number best noblest women have accepted with enthusiasm been guiding star distinguished statesmen achieved dominant position universities served source inspiration youth filled thoughts emotions both past present generation that history will some quite justly characterize socialism last decades countries people have done much they could make socialist ideal reality nationalizing municipalizing enterprises adopting measures designed lead planned economy defects necessarily involved socialist managementits unfavorable effects productivity human labor impossibility economic calculation under brought these endeavors point where virtually every step further direction socialism threatened flagrant impairment supply goods available public From sheer necessity pause road socialism socialist idealeven while preserving ideological practical politics merely cloak labor parties their scramble privileges This could shown true each many socialist parties such instance various factions among Christian socialists propose however confine discussion case Marxian socialists undoubtedly were most important socialist party Marx followers were really serious about socialism Marx rejected those measures behalf particular groups strata society that demanded parties special interests dispute validity liberal argument that outcome such acts interference only general reduction productivity labor When thought wrote spoke consistently always took position that every attempt tamper with mechanism capitalist system acts intervention part government other social organs armed with same coercive power pointless because does bring about result intended advocates instead reduces productivity economy Marx wanted organize workers conflict that would lead establishment socialism achievement certain special privileges within society still based private ownership means production wanted socialist labor party pettybourgeois party aiming individual piecemeal reforms Prevented blind adherence preconceptions scholastic system from taking unbiased view things they thought that workers whom writers under intellectual influence organized into socialist parties would content stand quietly watching evolution capitalist system according doctrine postpone when would fully ripe expropriation expropriators would turn into socialism that labor parties just like other parties special interests that were simultaneously springing everywhere while acknowledging socialist program correct principle practical politics were concerned only with immediate goal winning special privileges workers Marxist theory solidarity interests workers which Marx developed with quite other political ends view rendered excellent service skillfully concealing fact that costs victories some groups workers borne other groups workers that that field allegedly prolabor legislation well tradeunion struggles interests proletarians means coincide this respect Marxist doctrine performed same service party championing special interests workers accomplished German Centrist other clerical parties appeal religion nationalist parties appeal national solidarity agrarian parties contention that interests various groups agricultural producers identical protectionist parties doctrine necessity comprehensive tariff protection national labor more parties grew stronger became influence trade unions within them more they became association trade unions that everything from point view closed shop increase wages Liberalism does have least thing common with these parties stands very opposite pole from them promises special favors demands from everyone sacrifices behalf preservation society These sacrificesor more accurately renunciation immediately attainable advantagesare sure merely provisional they quickly themselves greater more lasting gains Nevertheless time being they sacrifices Because this liberalism finds itself from very outset peculiar position competition among parties antiliberal candidate promises special privileges every particular group voters higher prices producers lower

drawn from such doctrine program that promised something only group groups chance winning general support doomed from outset political failure Thus these parties other recourse than upon some

been reached some more important countries Where this lacking Russia Italy power state disregard remaining liberal principles that rest world still acknowledges used suppress persecute adherents opposition parties second circumstance that moment still prevents worst from happening that even nations imbued with hostility toward liberalism capitalism count capital investment from lands that have been classical exemplars liberal capitalist mentalityabove United States Without these credits consequences policy capital consumption that they have been pursuing would have already become much more obvious Anticapitalism maintain itself existence only sponging capitalism must therefore take into consideration certain extent public opinion West where liberalism still acknowledged today even though much diluted form fact that capitalists generally desire lend only such borrowers hold some prospect repaying loan destructionist parties profess that world ascendancy capital about which they raise such Liberalism Party Capital Thus easily seen that liberalism cannot into same class with parties special interests without denying very nature something radically different from them They battle extol violence liberalism contrary desires peace ascendancy ideas this reason that parties however badly disunited they otherwise form united front against liberalism enemies liberalism have branded party special interests capitalists This characteristic their mentality They simply cannot understand political ideology anything advocacy certain special privileges opposed general welfare cannot look liberalism party special interests privileges prerogatives because private ownership means production privilege redounding exclusive advantage capitalists institution interest whole society consequently institution that benefits everyone This opinion only liberals even certain point their opponents When Marxists champion view that socialism cannot made reality until world ripe because social system never becomes extinct before productive forces have developed which broad enough they concede least present social institution private property Even Bolsheviks only little while propagated with fire sword gallows their interpretation Marxismthat that ripeness already been achievednow have admit that still early however even only moment conditions such that capitalism juridical superstructure private property cannot dispensed with ideology that considers private property foundation society that serves only promote selfish interests owners capital against interests everyone else sure antiliberal ideologies treat private property indispensable whether just present forever they believe nevertheless that must regulated restricted authoritarian decrees similar acts intervention part state They recommend liberalism capitalism economics demonstrated that system contrary purpose selfdefeating cannot attain ends that advocates intend attain Consequently error suppose that besides socialism communal property capitalism private property still third system organizing social cooperation thinkable workable namely Attempts into effect must necessity lead conditions that counter intentions their authors then faced with alternative either abstaining from acts intervention thereby leaving private property replacing private property socialism This thesis that liberal economists alone maintaining course popular idea that economists divided along party lines altogether mistaken Marx theoretical discussions only alternatives socialism capitalism nothing derision contempt those reformers imprisoned pettybourgeois thinking reject socialism same time still want remodel capitalism Economics never even attempted show that system private property regulated restricted government intervention would practicable When socialists chair wanted prove this cost they began denying possibility scientific knowledge economic field ultimately ended declaring that whatever state does must surely rational Since science demonstrated absurdity policy that they wished recommend they sought invalidate logic science same true proof possibility practicability socialism preMarxist writers labored vain provide They could were they able attack validity weighty objections practicability their utopia that their critics based findings science Around middle nineteenth century socialist idea seemed already have been effectively disposed Then Marx made appearance sure adduce proofwhich indeed cannot adducedthat socialism realizable simply declaredof course without being able demonstrate itthat coming socialism inevitable From this arbitrary assumption from axiom which seemed selfevident that everything occurring later human history represents advance over what came earlier Marx drew conclusion that socialism therefore more perfect than capitalism there could naturally doubt practicability Consequently altogether unscientific concern oneself with question possibility socialist society even study problems such social order Whoever wanted ostracized socialists excommunicated public opinion which they controlled Heedless theseto sure only economics occupied itself with theoretical construction socialist system demonstrated irrefutably that every type socialism unworkable because economic calculation impossible socialist community advocates socialism have scarcely ventured make reply this what they have advanced rebuttal been altogether trivial devoid significance What proved science theoretically corroborated practice failure socialist experiments Hence nothing specious propaganda designed rely effectiveness lack judgment thoughtless assert people that defense capitalism purely affair capitalists entrepreneurs whose special interests opposed those other groups furthered capitalist system haves have more reason support institution private ownership means production than havenots their immediate special interests

Liberalism cannot count help that antiliberal parties receive from fact that everyone seeks some privilege himself expense rest society attaches himself them When liberal comes before electorate candidate public office asked those whose votes solicits what party intends them their group only answer give Liberalism serves everyone serves special interest liberal have realized that special

with Planned Chaos Omnipotent Government Human Action Mentality Term Liberalism Those familiar with writings subject liberalism that have appeared last years with current linguistic usage will perhaps object that what been called liberalism present volume does coincide with what understood that term contemporary political literature from disputing this contrary have myself expressly pointed that what understood term liberalism today especially Germany stands direct opposition what history ideas must designate liberalism because constituted essential content liberal program eighteenth nineteenth centuries Almost call themselves liberals today decline profess themselves favor private ownership means production advocate measures partly socialist partly They seek justify this ground that essence liberalism does consist adherence institution private property other things that these other things demand further development liberalism that must today longer advocate private ownership means production instead either socialism just what these other things might these pseudo liberals have enlighten hear much about humanity magnanimity real freedom These certainly very fine noble sentiments everyone will readily subscribe them fact every ideology does subscribe them Every ideologyaside from cynical schools that championing humanity magnanimity real freedom What distinguishes social doctrine from another ultimate goal universal human happiness which they which they seek attain this characteristic feature liberalism that proposes reach private ownership means production terminological issues after secondary importance What counts name thing signified However fanatical ones opposition private property must still concede least possibility that someone favor concedes this much will course have have some name designate this school thought must those today call themselves liberals what name they would give ideology that advocates preservation private ownership means production They will perhaps answer that they wish call this ideology Manchesterism word Manchesterism originally coined term derision abuse Nevertheless this would stand being employed designate liberal ideology were fact that this expression hitherto always been used denote economic rather than general program liberalism school thought that advocates private ownership means production must case also granted claim some name other best adhere traditional name would create only confusion followed usage that allows even protectionists socialists warmongers call themselves liberal when suits them question could rather raised whether interest facilitating diffusion liberal ideas ought give ideology liberalism name that general prejudice fostered against especially Germany should stand Such suggestion would completely antithetic spirit liberalism just liberalism must from inner necessity eschew every trick propaganda underhanded means winning general acceptance favored other movements must also avoid abandoning name simply because unpopular Precisely because word liberal connotation Germany liberalism must stick make liberal thinking easier anyone what importance that declare themselves liberals that they become liberals think liberals second objection that raised against terminology used this book that liberalism democracy here conceived opposites Today Germany liberalism often taken mean doctrine whose political ideal constitutional monarchy democracy understood that which takes political ideal parliamentary monarchy republic This view even historically altogether untenable parliamentary constitutional monarchy that liberalism strove defeat this regard consisted precisely fact that German Empire Austria able achieve only constitutional monarchy triumph antiliberalism fact that German Reichstag weak that might accurately politely characterized babblers club conservative party leader said that lieutenant twelve would suffice dissolve Reichstag speaking truth Liberalism more comprehensive concept denotes ideology embracing social life ideology democracy encompasses only that part realm social relationships that refers constitution state reason liberalism must necessarily demand democracy political corollary demonstrated first part this book show antiliberal movements including socialism must also antidemocratic task investigations

fact their true character character bestowed them laws under which they live will denied that these proper criterion because only under pretext that laws have transformed negroes into subjects property that place disputed them computation numbers admitted that laws were restore rights which have been taken away negroes could longer refused equal share representation with other inhabitants This question placed another light agreed sides that numbers best scale wealth taxation they only proper scale representation Would convention have been impartial consistent they rejected slaves from list inhabitants when shares representation were calculated inserted them lists when tariff contributions adjusted Could reasonably expected that Southern States would concur system which considered their slaves some degree when burdens were imposed refused consider them same light when advantages were conferred Might some surprise also expressed that those reproach Southern States with barbarous policy considering property part their human brethren should themselves contend that government which States parties ought consider this unfortunate race more completely unnatural light property than very laws which they complain replied perhaps that slaves included estimate States possessing them They neither vote themselves increase votes their masters Upon what principle then ought they taken into federal estimate representation rejecting them altogether Constitution would this respect have followed very laws which have been appealed proper guide This objection repelled single observation

property committed into same hands with personal rights Some attention ought therefore paid property choice those hands another reason votes allowed federal legislature people each State ought bear some proportion comparative wealth States States have like individuals influence over each other arising from superior advantages fortune allows opulent citizen single vote choice representative

State possesses such influence over other States probable that richest State Confederacy will ever influence choice single representative other State will larger richer States possess other advantage federal legislature over other States than what result from their superior number alone therefore their superior wealth weight justly entitle them advantage ought secured them superior share representation Constitution this respect materially different from existing Confederation well from that United Netherlands other similar confederacies each latter efficacy federal resolutions depends subsequent voluntary resolutions states composing union Hence states though possessing equal vote public councils have unequal influence corresponding with unequal importance these subsequent voluntary resolutions Under proposed Constitution federal acts will take effect without necessary intervention individual States They will depend merely majority votes federal legislature consequently each vote whether proceeding from larger smaller State State more less wealthy powerful will have equal weight efficacy same manner votes individually given State legislature unequal counties other

Such reasoning which advocate Southern interests might employ this subject although appear little strained some points whole must confess that fully reconciles scale representation which convention

objections that provision question confounds legislative judiciary authorities same body violation that important well established maxim which requires separation between different departments power true meaning this maxim been discussed ascertained another place been shown entirely compatible with partial intermixture those departments special purposes preserving them main distinct unconnected This partial intermixture even some cases only proper necessary mutual defense several members government against each other absolute qualified negative executive upon acts legislative body admitted ablest adepts political science indispensable barrier against encroachments latter upon former perhaps with less reason contended that powers relating impeachments before intimated essential check hands that body upon encroachments executive division them between branches legislature assigning right accusing other right judging avoids inconvenience making same persons both accusers judges guards against danger persecution from prevalency factious spirit either those branches concurrence thirds Senate will requisite condemnation security innocence from this additional circumstance will complete itself desire curious observe with what vehemence this part plan assailed principle here taken notice profess admire without exception constitution this State while that constitution makes Senate together with chancellor judges Supreme Court only court impeachments highest judicatory State causes civil criminal proportion point numbers chancellor judges senators inconsiderable that judiciary authority York last resort with truth said reside Senate plan convention this respect chargeable with departure from celebrated maxim which been often mentioned seems little understood much more culpable must constitution York SECOND objection Senate court impeachments that contributes undue accumulation power that body tending give government countenance aristocratic Senate observed have concurrent authority with Executive formation treaties appointment offices objectors these prerogatives added that deciding cases impeachment will give decided predominancy senatorial influence objection little precise itself easy find very precise answer Where measure criterion which appeal determining what will give Senate much little barely proper degree influence Will more safe well more simple dismiss such vague uncertain calculations examine each power itself decide general principles where deposited with most advantage least inconvenience take this course will lead more intelligible more certain result disposition power making treaties which obtained plan convention will then mistake appear fully justified considerations stated former number others which will occur under next head inquiries expediency junction Senate with Executive power appointing offices will trust placed light less satisfactory disquisitions under same head flatter myself observations last paper must have gone inconsiderable towards proving that easy practicable find more receptacle power determining impeachments than that which been chosen this truly case hypothetical dread great weight Senate ought discarded from reasonings this hypothesis such already been refuted remarks applied duration office prescribed senators them shown well credit historical examples from reason thing that most POPULAR branch every government partaking republican genius being generally favorite people will generally full match overmatch every other member Government independent this most active operative principle secure equilibrium national House plan convention provided favor several important counterpoises additional authorities conferred upon Senate exclusive privilege originating money bills will belong House same house will possess sole right instituting impeachments this complete counterbalance that determining them same house will umpire elections President which unite suffrages majority whole number electors case which cannot doubted will sometimes frequently happen constant possibility thing must fruitful source influence that body more contemplated more important will appear this ultimate though contingent power deciding competitions most illustrious citizens Union first office would perhaps rash predict that mean influence will found outweigh peculiar attributes Senate THIRD objection Senate court impeachments drawn from agency they have appointments office imagined that they would indulgent judges conduct whose official creation they participated principle this objection would condemn practice which seen State governments governments with which acquainted mean that rendering those hold offices during pleasure dependent pleasure those appoint them With equal plausibility might alleged this case that favoritism latter would always asylum misbehavior former that practice contradiction this principle proceeds upon presumption that responsibility those appoint fitness competency persons whom they bestow their choice interest they will have respectable prosperous administration affairs will inspire sufficient disposition dismiss from share such their conduct shall have proved themselves unworthy confidence reposed them Though facts always correspond with this presumption main just must destroy supposition that Senate will merely sanction choice Executive should feel bias towards objects that choice strong enough blind them evidences guilt extraordinary have induced nation become accusers further arguments were necessary evince improbability such bias might found nature agency Senate business appointments will office President NOMINATE with advice consent Senate APPOINT There will course exertion CHOICE part Senate They defeat choice Executive oblige make another they cannot themselves CHOOSE they only ratify reject choice President They might even entertain preference some other person very moment they were assenting proposed because there might positive ground opposition they could sure they withheld their assent that subsequent nomination would fall upon their favorite upon other person their estimation more meritorious than rejected Thus could hardly happen that majority Senate would feel other complacency towards object appointment than such appearances merit might inspire proofs want destroy FOURTH objection Senate capacity court impeachments derived from union with Executive power making treaties This been said would constitute senators their judges every case corrupt perfidious execution that trust After having combined with Executive betraying interests nation ruinous treaty what prospect asked would there their being made suffer punishment they would deserve when they were themselves decide upon accusation brought against them treachery which they have been guilty This objection been circulated with more earnestness with greater show reason than other which appeared against this part plan deceived does rest upon erroneous foundation security essentially intended Constitution against corruption treachery formation treaties sought numbers characters those make them JOINT AGENCY Chief Magistrate Union thirds members body selected collective wisdom legislatures several States designed pledge fidelity national councils this particular convention might with propriety have meditated punishment Executive deviation from instructions Senate want integrity conduct negotiations committed they might also have view punishment leading individuals Senate should have prostituted their influence that body mercenary instruments foreign corruption they could with more with equal propriety have contemplated impeachment punishment thirds Senate consenting improper treaty than majority that other branch national legislature consenting pernicious principle which believe never been admitted into government fact could majority House impeach themselves better evident than thirds Senate might themselves what reason there that majority House sacrificing interests society unjust tyrannical legislation should escape with impunity more than thirds Senate sacrificing same interests injurious treaty with foreign power truth that such cases essential freedom necessary independence deliberations body that members should exempt from punishment acts done collective capacity security society must depend care which taken confide trust proper hands make their interest execute with fidelity make difficult possible them combine interest opposite that public good might concern misbehavior Executive perverting instructions contravening views Senate need apprehensive want disposition that body punish abuse their confidence vindicate their authority thus count upon their pride upon their virtue even might concern corruption leading members whose arts influence majority have been inveigled into measures odious community proofs that corruption should satisfactory usual

done legislative regulation propositions which have been made supplying omission have rather served illustrate than obviate difficulty thing minority Pennsylvania have proposed this mode expression purpose Trial jury shall heretofore this maintain would senseless nugatory United States their united collective capacity OBJECT which general provisions Constitution must necessarily construed refer evident that though trial jury with various limitations known each State individually United States SUCH this time altogether unknown because present federal government judiciary power whatever consequently there proper antecedent previous establishment which term HERETOFORE could relate would therefore destitute precise meaning inoperative from uncertainty hand form provision would fulfil

before king himself privy council where fact well undergoes reexamination This alone demonstrates impolicy inserting fundamental provision Constitution which would make State systems standard national government article under consideration danger encumbering government with constitutional provisions propriety which indisputable convictions equally strong that great advantages result from separation equity from jurisdiction that causes which belong former would improperly committed juries great primary court equity give relief EXTRAORDINARY CASES which EXCEPTIONS general rules unite jurisdiction such cases with ordinary jurisdiction must have tendency unsettle general rules subject every case that arises SPECIAL determination while separation from other contrary effect rendering sentinel over

require often such long deliberate critical investigation would impracticable called from their occupations obliged decide before they were permitted return them simplicity expedition which form distinguishing characters this mode trial require that matter decided should reduced some single obvious point while litigations usual chancery frequently comprehend long train minute independent particulars true that separation equity from legal jurisdiction peculiar English system jurisprudence which model that been followed several States equally true that trial jury been unknown every case which they have been united separation essential preservation that institution pristine purity nature court equity will readily permit extension jurisdiction matters little suspected that attempt extend jurisdiction courts matters equity will only unproductive advantages which derived from courts chancery plan upon which they established this State will tend gradually change nature courts undermine trial jury introducing questions complicated decision that mode These appeared conclusive reasons against incorporating systems States formation national judiciary according what conjectured have been attempt Pennsylvania minority examine proposition Massachusetts calculated remedy supposed defect this form civil actions between citizens different States every issue fact arising ACTIONS COMMON tried jury parties either them request This best proposition confined description causes inference fair either that Massachusetts convention considered that only class federal causes which trial jury would proper that desirous more extensive provision they found impracticable devise which would properly answer first omission regulation respecting partial object never considered material imperfection system last affords strong corroboration extreme difficulty thing this advert observations already made respecting courts that subsist several States Union different powers exercised them will appear that there expressions more vague indeterminate than those which have been employed characterize THAT species causes which intended shall entitled trial jury this State boundaries between actions common actions equitable jurisdiction ascertained conformity rules which prevail England upon that subject many other States boundaries less precise some them every cause tried court common upon that foundation every action considered action common determined jury parties either them choose Hence same irregularity confusion would introduced compliance with this proposition that have already noticed resulting from regulation proposed Pennsylvania minority State cause would receive determination from jury parties either them requested another State cause exactly similar other must decided without intervention jury because State judicatories varied commonlaw jurisdiction obvious therefore that Massachusetts proposition upon this subject cannot operate general regulation until some uniform plan with respect limits commonlaw equitable jurisdictions shall adopted different States devise plan that kind task arduous itself which would require much time reflection mature would extremely difficult impossible suggest general regulation that would acceptable States Union that would perfectly quadrate with several State institutions asked could reference have been made

which been shown institutions enemies plan would have been furnished with fine pretext raising host local prejudices against which perhaps might have hazarded inconsiderable degree final establishment avoid embarrassments definition cases which trial jury ought embrace sometimes suggested enthusiastic tempers that provision might have been inserted establishing cases whatsoever this believe

great essential object introducing firm national government cannot persuade myself other hand that different lights which subject been placed course these observations will towards removing candid

foregoing review Constitution have taken notice endeavored answer most objections which have appeared against There however remain which either fall naturally under particular head were forgotten their proper places These shall discussed subject been drawn into great length shall consult brevity comprise observations these miscellaneous points single paper most considerable remaining objections that plan convention contains bill rights Among other answers given this been upon different occasions remarked that constitutions several States similar predicament that York number opposers system this State profess unlimited admiration constitution among most intemperate partisans bill rights justify their zeal this matter they allege things that though constitution York bill rights prefixed contains body various provisions favor particular privileges rights which substance amount same thing other that Constitution adopts their full extent common statute Great Britain which many other rights expressed equally secured first answer that Constitution proposed convention contains well constitution this State number such provisions Independent those which relate structure government find following Article section clause Judgment cases impeachment shall extend further than removal from office hold enjoy office honor trust profit under United States party convicted shall nevertheless liable subject indictment trial judgment punishment according Section same article clause privilege writ habeas corpus shall suspended unless when cases rebellion invasion

this fatal evil everywhere peculiarly emphatical encomiums habeascorpus which place calls BULWARK British Constitution Nothing need said illustrate importance prohibition titles nobility This truly denominated cornerstone republican government long they excluded there never serious danger that government will other than that people second that pretended establishment common state Constitution answer that they expressly made subject such alterations provisions legislature shall from time time make concerning same They therefore moment liable repeal ordinary legislative power course have constitutional sanction only declaration recognize ancient remove doubts which might have been occasioned Revolution This consequently considered part declaration rights which under constitutions must intended limitations power government itself been several times truly remarked that bills rights their origin stipulations between kings their subjects abridgements prerogative favor privilege reservations rights surrendered prince Such MAGNA CHARTA obtained barons sword hand from King John Such were subsequent confirmations that charter succeeding princes Such PETITION RIGHT assented Charles beginning reign Such also Declaration Right presented Lords Commons Prince Orange afterwards thrown into form parliament called Bill Rights evident therefore that according their primitive signification they have application constitutions professedly founded upon power people executed their immediate servants Here strictness people surrender nothing they retain every thing they have need particular reservations PEOPLE United States secure blessings liberty ourselves posterity ORDAIN ESTABLISH this Constitution United States America Here better recognition popular rights than volumes those aphorisms which make principal figure several State bills rights which would sound much better treatise ethics than constitution government minute detail particular rights certainly less applicable Constitution like that under consideration which merely intended regulate general political interests nation than constitution which regulation every species personal private concerns therefore loud clamors against plan convention this score well founded epithets reprobation will strong constitution this State truth that both them contain which relation their objects reasonably desired further affirm that bills rights sense extent which they contended only unnecessary proposed Constitution would even dangerous They would contain various exceptions powers granted this very account would afford colorable pretext claim more than were granted declare that things shall done which there power instance should said that liberty press shall restrained when power given which restrictions imposed will contend that such provision would confer regulating power evident that would furnish disposed usurp plausible pretense claiming that power They might urge with semblance reason that Constitution ought charged with absurdity providing against abuse authority which given that provision against restraining liberty press afforded clear implication that power prescribe proper regulations concerning intended vested national government This serve specimen numerous handles which would given doctrine constructive powers indulgence injudicious zeal bills rights subject liberty press much been said cannot forbear adding remark first place observe that there syllable concerning constitution this State next contend that whatever been said about that other State amounts nothing What signifies declaration that liberty press shall inviolably preserved What liberty press give definition which would leave utmost latitude evasion hold impracticable from this infer that security whatever fine declarations inserted constitution respecting must altogether depend public opinion general spirit people government here after intimated upon another occasion must seek only solid basis rights There remains other view this matter conclude point truth after declamations have heard that Constitution itself every rational sense every useful purpose BILL RIGHTS several bills rights Great Britain form Constitution conversely constitution each State bill rights proposed Constitution adopted will bill rights Union object bill rights declare specify political privileges citizens structure administration government This done most ample precise manner plan convention comprehending various precautions public security which found State constitutions another object bill rights define certain immunities modes proceeding which relative personal private concerns This have seen also been attended variety cases same plan Adverting therefore substantial meaning bill rights absurd allege that found work convention said that does enough though will easy make this appear with propriety contended that there such thing certainly must immaterial what mode observed order declaring rights citizens they found part instrument which establishes government hence must apparent that much what been said this subject rests merely verbal nominal distinctions entirely foreign from substance thing Another objection which been made which from frequency repetition presumed relied this nature improper Usay objectorse confer such large powers proposed upon national government because seat that government must necessity remote from many States admit proper knowledge part constituent conduct representative body This argument proves thing proves that there ought general government whatever powers which seems agreed hands ought vested Union cannot safely intrusted body which under every requisite control there satisfactory reasons show that objection reality well founded There most arguments which relate distance palpable illusion imagination What sources information which people Montgomery County must regulate their judgment conduct their State legislature personal observation they have benefit This confined citizens spot They must therefore depend information intelligent whom they confide must these obtain their information Evidently from complexion public measures from public prints from with with other persons reside place their deliberations This does apply Montgomery County only counties considerable distance from seat government equally

intelligence they never loss know behavior those represent their constituents national councils readily communicate same knowledge people Their disposition apprise community whatever prejudice interests from another quarter relied upon were only from rivalship power conclude with fullest assurance that people through that channel will better informed conduct their national than they means they possess that their State ought also remembered that citizens inhabit country near seat government will questions that affect general liberty prosperity have same interest with those distance that they will stand ready sound alarm when necessary point actors pernicious project public papers will expeditious messengers intelligence most remote inhabitants Union Among many curious objections which have appeared against proposed Constitution most extraordinary least colorable derived from want some provision respecting debts United States This been represented tacit relinquishment those debts wicked contrivance screen public defaulters newspapers have teemed with most inflammatory railings this head there nothing clearer than that suggestion entirely void foundation offspring extreme ignorance extreme dishonesty addition remarks have made upon subject another place shall only observe that plain dictate commonsense also established doctrine political that STATES NEITHER LOSE THEIR

federal government single body being unsafe depositary such ample authorities conceding this question expense must given impossible with degree safety narrow foundation upon which system stand

this will occasion increase public expense will most cases nothing more than exchange State national officers collection duties instance persons employed will wholly latter description States individually will stand need this purpose What difference make point expense officers customs appointed State United States There good reason suppose that either number salaries latter will greater

because there president Congress whose expenses thing short those which will incurred account President United States support judges will clearly extra expense what extent will depend particular plan which adopted regard this matter upon reasonable plan amount which will object material consequence what there counterbalance extra expense that attend establishment proposed government first thing which presents itself that great part business which keeps Congress sitting through year will transacted President Even management foreign negotiations will naturally devolve upon according general principles concerted with Senate subject their final concurrence Hence evident that portion year will suffice session both Senate House suppose about fourth latter third perhaps half former extra business treaties appointments give this extra occupation Senate From this circumstance infer that until House shall increased greatly beyond present number there will considerable saving expense from difference between constant session present temporary session future Congress there another circumstance great importance view economy business United States hitherto occupied State legislatures well Congress latter made requisitions which former have provide Hence happened that sessions State legislatures have been protracted greatly beyond what necessary execution mere local business States More than half their time been frequently employed matters which related United States members compose legislatures several States amount thousand upwards which number hitherto performed what under system

human destiny beyond human beings cannot differences least make world safe diversity government social system evil that people must considered lacking virtue Nuclear powers must avert those

that inhabit this small planet breathe same cherish childrens future mortal have therefore chosen this time this place discuss topic which ignorance often abounds truth rarely perceived most important topic earth world peace What kind peace mean What kind peace seek Americana enforced world American weapons peace grave security slave talking about genuine peace kind peace that makes life earth worth living kind that enables nations grow hope build better life their children merely peace Americans peace women merely peace time peace time speak peace because face Total makes sense when great

acquired purpose making sure never need them essential keeping peace surely acquisition such idle only destroy never createis only much less most efficient means assuring peace speak peace therefore necessary rational rational realize that pursuit peace dramatic pursuit warand frequently words pursuer fall deaf ears have more urgent task Some that useless speak world peace world world
