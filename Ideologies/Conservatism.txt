have they been around Candidate ratings have long history American politics they have become increasingly familiar part political landscape Broadly defined candidate ratings sometimes called rankings scorecards scores that various political academic media organizations assign politicians based voting records issue stances public statements more recently campaign contributions political leanings these organizations cover full political spectrum reasons methods rating politicians have changed over time vary from group group When politically active organizations such American Federation Labor National Farmers Union pioneered practice rating elected officials early centuryin were primarily focused advancing their political interests example rated officials based their stances records laborrelated issues while concentrated farming issues Both organizations advertised their ratings their members general public attempting shape voter preferences advocate candidates most closely aligned with their political interests Numerous politically active organizations followed AFLs lead wasnt long until groups dedicated issues such environment free markets religion family values reproductive rights civil many many otherswere also rating politicians study estimated that time Ronald Reagan second term over organizations were actively rating members Congress other politicians United States early century that number ballooned into hundreds today groups dedicated whole range different issues systematically rate elected officials political candidates alike rise legislative candidate ratings also seen emergence objective rating organizations These latter organizations similar methodologies those used political interest groupssuch relying upon issue stances public statements voting recordsbut rate candidates objectively broad political spectrum without regard specific political issues interests read candidate ratings Context critical reading candidate ratings reason this that many organizations that conduct ratings only from perspective their particular interests from their political pointsofview well conservative organization instance will more often than assign lower ratings Democrats higher ratings Republicans same said about liberal organizations that same token groups further right will likely rate higher Republicans they view more conservative
